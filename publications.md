Note : I try to be as FOSS of a person as I can and prefer publishing on my blog. As a result most of my work is documented in the "projects" tab. But things change slightly when there are academics and conferencing involved. You meet great people at conferences and there are financial interests associated with such activities.

Brands are a things you and I cannot ignore, but one should not be forced to accept. There value, although fictional is highly valued. The value of bread on a common man's plate.
