I"’<p>Standies? They are everywhere. Every event. Every exhibition, Flying around, falling down numerous times, a pain to manage them and even get people to read it.</p>

<p>We had the opportunity to design a reactive standie for <a href="http://saavn.com/">Saavn</a> that will be present at their stalls throughout NH7 2015 Music festival.</p>

<p>Its apparently a XXL Sized phone with a UI that lists the artists playing at that festival and has their albums on the standie itself.</p>

<p>So, like a big screen a person could walk and press/tap/touch their artist and enjoy the selected music for the festival.</p>

<p>Checkout out the video of the standie in action.</p>
