I"¶<p>So, I am back here. I was away for a bit. The reasons were described in the previous post. I had already written a part of the post an year back. Since then, I did manage to read a few more books and reflect on what could have been more useful for IDC students. Things that could have provided a better understanding of the â€œdesignâ€ industry. I have, hence, updated the list.</p>

<p>Let me know what you think about the list.</p>
