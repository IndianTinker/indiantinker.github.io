<p>In a recent class on Typesetting we were assigned a task to typeset an entire book, preferably an Open Book, using your favorite typesetting Program in a few days time. Typesetting is not <em>easy</em> especially when you do it in <strong>LaTeX</strong> and with the skill going rusty it was a hot pot of dilemmas that I think should not be a part of this post at all.</p>

<p>The book I choose was in ePub format and desperately needed to be converted to latex files so I can typeset them in <a href="http://overleaf.com/">overleaf</a> or <a href="http://sharelatex.com/">sharelatex</a> or <em>texworks</em> as a matter of fact. I have moved in the favour of these online compilers as I no longer have to fiddle with searching the included <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.sty</code> that are so robotic to seek and use. I really wish there was some kind of package manager for latex too. Like pip for python. 
<em>I Wish</em> !</p>

<p>ePubs are essentially a zipped archive of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.html</code> files following a specific numbering scheme or format. So the task was essentially to convert the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.html</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.tex</code>. I did try a few things with python trying the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">beautiful soup</code> things. It did not taste well. I had to search other things.</p>

<p>I had heard of <a href="http://pandoc.org/">pandoc</a> while I was writing my thesis few years back too but it <em>felt</em> to complex that time but now it was a necessity I just canâ€™t ignore. Its interesting how the perceived complexity of a act changes with necessity. <strong>Pandoc</strong> is the Swiss army knife when handling documents. It can do anything. It took me a while to figure out it was a CLI tool. ( It happens )</p>

<p>It could translate the html page <em>almost</em> perfectly to be used in <em>overleaf</em>. Only some italics were not getting done properly for which I used <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sed</code> and compiled it all in a shell script to iterate over the entire folder and in a blink I had a directory full of tex files ready for the next stage.</p>

<p>The work was only 10% done as a lot of widows needed new husbands and orphans needed parents, I hope you get what I mean !</p>

<p>Just in case you too are a fan of <strong>LaTeX</strong> , the code I used and wrote is <a href="https://github.com/IndianTinker/EPUB-to-Latex">here</a>.</p>
