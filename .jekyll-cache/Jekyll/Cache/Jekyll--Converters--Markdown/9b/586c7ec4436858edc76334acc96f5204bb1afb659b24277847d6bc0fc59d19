I"<p>It has been almost an year. I have been out of IDC and working/studying here in Spain. As I continue to explore design, I often read books that I feel could answer many questions I had. I hope students still have a lot of questions. In this brief post, I present a collection of books I came across that could help design students perceive design better. I hope they keep you well insulated.</p>

<p>The list is arranged in order of possible things you could have in mind at a particular time in the course. So, I have structured them semester wise. <br /></p>

<p>Thanks to Malay, Chinmay, Rishabh, and Advait for their contributions and suggestions. Thanks to Prof. Girish, who named some of these books in conversations.
This is the Part I, Part II comes in a week or so.</p>
