I"N<p><i>The funeral pyre,</i></p>

<p><i>The heat of its fire.</i></p>

<p><i>The cries and tears</i></p>

<p><i>The memories and bonds</i></p>

<p><i>Are all broken now. </i>
<br />
 <i>Sorry! I could not see you.</i></p>

<p><i>He cried,</i></p>

<p><i>Sorry! I left you alone</i></p>

<p><i>He wept.</i></p>

<p><i>Sorry! I was not there</i></p>

<p><i>He wrote.</i>
<br />
 <i>As smoke carried his grandpa</i></p>

<p><i> He stood there.</i></p>

<p><i>The smoke is what were are</i></p>

<p><i>he once said</i></p>

<p><i>and smoke is what he became </i></p>

<p><i>in the end. </i></p>
