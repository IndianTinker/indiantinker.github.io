<p>A curious designer and doer who belives in the power of design to generate discussions about the present and probable. I try to approach design as a dialogue with problems and not mediums. I am fan of philosophy to explain modern condition and expand thinking. Guess my favourite philosophers?</p>

<p>Into DIY, languages, research, cycling, reflective behaviours, speculation, and emotions. My favourite objects are maps, mirrors, and clocks. I have built things from matchsticks to solar cars.</p>

<p>I am currently with the Digital Design Lab, Istituto Europeo di Design, Madrid working on projects around communities and affective environments.</p>

  <p>About this website: This website is made using jekyll with some need specific plugins I wrote like location, open graph support, contextual photo crop, and others. If you noticed, the font is Nunito. I love it for its semi-serious feel. It is not too sharp and not at all comic. It resonates with me. I tried following good typography rules and use relative spacing. The website is mobile friendly. It is <a href="https://www.websitecarbon.com/website/rohitg-in/">88% greener</a> in terms of environmental impact. The website is designed to follow many Web Accessibility Guidelines.</p>
