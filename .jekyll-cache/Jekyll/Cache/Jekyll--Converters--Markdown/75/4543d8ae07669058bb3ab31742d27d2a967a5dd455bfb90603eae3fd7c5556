  <p>This post describes the work done as a part of a course I took at <em>School of Design, IIT Bombay</em> . The name of the course is <strong>Interaction Media and Senses</strong>. The project was done during the <em>sensory</em> phase of the course that involved Sensory, Cognitive and Social parts with <a href="https://www.behance.net/m_mankad">Manasi</a> and <a href="https://www.behance.net/ankit_bansod">Ankit</a></p>

<p>We explored the possible ways to experience at city by just sounds and ended up creating a system that maps these sounds as well. The system can be seen in action <a href="http://rohitg.in/soundsofcity.html">here</a>. It uses Mapbox flavoured openstreet maps with soundcloud to embed the recorded sounds.</p>

<p>We experimented with things like :</p>

<ul>
  <li>Binaural Recording</li>
  <li>Storytelling with sound</li>
  <li>Spatial augmentation of sound using 3 axis sensors and openAL. (To be replaced by Unity or SFML)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>User controlled spatial sound system</strong></p>

<p>The data is read from the accelerometer and the spatial audio field is manipulated using pyOpenAL.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Geospatial Mapping of Sound (prototyped using processing and implemented using MapBox)</li>
</ul>

<p>The project is documented in the video below: ( I will add a one page TL;dr version soon )</p>
