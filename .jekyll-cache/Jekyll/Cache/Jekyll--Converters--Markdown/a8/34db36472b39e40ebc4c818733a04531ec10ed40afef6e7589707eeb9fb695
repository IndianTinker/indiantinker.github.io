I"Ç<p>I have recently been working on my blog on using <em>Jekyll</em> on <strong>Github Pages</strong> and the experience has been wonderful.<!--more--> It a lot easier than wordpress where I have to login and do all kinds of formatting to churn out a decent looking post. Here its just Markdown and some pre configurations and I just need to update a github repo at the end of it.</p>

<p>Interestingly, Jekyll supports <a href="liquidmarkup.org/">Liquid</a> a templating engine built on ruby that is developed by e commerce giant <em>Shopify</em>.
Using Liquid we can add some basic logic ( and maybe advance too) to the blog like categorization and tagging. Tagging is not available out of the box with Jekyll but can be implemented easily using <strong>Liquid</strong> .</p>

<p>It essentially involves two steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Editing YML front matter (The thing between the 3 dashes)</li>
  <li>Creating a Category page to automatically accumulate all the tags you added</li>
</ol>

<p>After this the changes will be reflected on compilation. And Voila! You would have added tags to your blog!</p>

<p>Lets get started.</p>

<p>Add a Tags variable to the frontmatter block and list the tags as shown the following example:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>---
layout: post
title: Tagging Jekyll
tags:
- Jekyll
- Blogging
- web
---
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Next, create a page in the root or in whatever way you have configured Jekyll to pick new page and create a page say <em>Categories</em> etc.
Lets name it Categories.md</p>

<p>Use the following snippet to display tags.</p>

<noscript><pre>400: Invalid request</pre></noscript>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/3eddb75957eaf9f9b8e8.js"> </script>

<p>Now</p>

<p>jekyll build
jekyll serve</p>

<p>and see the changes in the blog on <em>http://localhost:4000</em>.
If you face any issues be sure to comment here .</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>
