  <p>This post presents a commissioned public installation on the occasion of Republic Day. <a href="https://mkrv.in/">We</a> worked a creating an abstract digital reflection of the visitors to evoke feeling of togetherness.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We tried to understand the work in terms<!--more--> of a popular saying about India, ‚ÄúUnity in Diversity‚Äù. We aimed at exhibiting concepts that show how we as Indians, accommodate our diversity and stay united. A fundamental view was taken as it presents the visitor with an idea that essentially everyone is same and differences are ,as Harari says, fictional. Hence, a reflection was thought in terms of a shape and a structure.</p>

<p>We used a Kinect sensor with OpenNI to implement this project.</p>

<h4 id="shape">Shape</h4>
<p>The shape metaphor presents visitor with a enlarged silhouette of themselves. The colour of the silhouette varies between saffron,white and green. These are the colors from the national flag. When a lot of people come closer, they all merge into one band, symbolizing - oneness, unity</p>

<h4 id="structure">Structure</h4>
<p>The structure metaphor was chosen to show abstract animated representations of self. These were inspired from human forms in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warli">Warli</a> art style. The visitors would walk in front of the screen and notice their Warli representation. The forms react to the visitors motion. They are colored in the Indian tri-color.</p>
