<p>Never mind a broken device is an opportunity to learn. Thatâ€™s what i had in mind when i didnt throw away my 2004 ATX supply when it failed in 2010 probably due to some connection/connector issue. In a haste to get the PC working in summer break I installed a new supply on the PC and kept it with me to play with later.</p>

<p>After saving it from the routine disposal drives of Diwali , I finally had some use of it when the WalWart 12V@1A supply i have was not capable of driving the stepper motors i used in my major project.</p>

<p>Moding ATX to use it as a bench supply is not new.The power output is pretty stable and can provide high currents. DP has an amazing <a href="http://dangerousprototypes.com/2012/06/28/new-prototype-atx-breakout-board/">ATX to Power supply Board</a> too.</p>

<p>I wanted one that i could carry around anywhere and should be in one piece and durable with no wires outside the case except the power cable of course .</p>

<p>Lets see how that ATX Connector looks like.</p>

<p>The important points are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Shorting <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PS_ON(14)</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GND</code> will turn on the PSU and that is what actually the motherboard does.</li>
  <li>By checking the voltage on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Power_ok or Power Good(8)</code> one can decide whether the power supply OUTPUT is ON (+5V when ON).</li>
  <li>By checking the voltage on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">+5vSB(9)</code> one can decide whether the Mains are ON or not (+5v when ON).</li>
</ul>

<p>So, I will connect LEDs to pin 8 and 9 and a switch between 14 and GND, thats pretty much it.</p>

<p>Since I had the no wires outside clause and usual power supplies have more that one connector, I had to open the power supply and cut wires literally like a barber and then solder the same coloured ones together to bring them onto the front panel.</p>

  <p>Most morden ATXs donâ€™t need the load resistor on 5V bus as many posts mention. Phew ! One part less :D</p>

<p>I then drilled the holes @ CEDT for the Thumb Screw connectors i got from Lajpat Rai and also fixed a small handle to it for carrying it around.</p>

<p>Then connected the circuit as mentioned above to test it.</p>

<p>Carefully packed everything inside the original case.</p>

<p>Printed some labels from my archaic inkjet and I had my ATX power Supply ready !</p>

<p>Pretty simple and effective hack ! So, when are you making one ?</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>
