I"K<p>This post was made to avoid me “replaying” the episodic events of placements to whoever comes in to do groundwork for the post of a Placement Manager. It feels more like interrogation from unknown individuals.</p>

<p>The following is the “job description” for an IDC DPC. I hope that this would change in the future. Students, typically - IDCians and IDC DPCs would get more accountable to the work they signed up for. The point to remember is that everyone has work during those days and giving up on your position does not help in a highly connected system like the placements. It only increases the stress on other members.</p>

<p>The list is (mostly chronological) :</p>

<ol>
  <li>Getting students to pay for the placements.</li>
  <li>Ask them to join the “not-so-useful” google group</li>
  <li>Help them make resumes and get it verified, iteratively.</li>
  <li>Collect companies from various sources like:
    <ul>
      <li>Wishlists</li>

  <li>Ask them iteratively to send the details for verification</li>
  <li>Get the JAF verified from EO and EXO</li>
  <li>Slot the companies</li>

  <li>Put up a blog post for the same</li>
  <li>Push JAF information on Whatsapp and contact some individual students who are not there on these platforms via email and phone</li>
  <li>Solve student queries regarding JAFS and help them apply for the same</li>
  <li>Push students to apply as they wont and wait for the last moment</li>
  <li>Inform companies that the JAF has closed and assist them in downloading the resumes/portfolios</li>
  <li>Push them to release shortlists, if any</li>
  <li>Push shortlist on blog.</li>

  <li>co-ordinate with HRs about housing, food and travel</li>
  <li>Make PPTs happen</li>
  <li>Teach students how to fill preferences and get them filled</li>
  <li>Search for SPOCs on the day of placement. Kids you have never met.</li>
  <li>Get the floor plan made and SPOCs ready to turn up.</li>
  <li>Mail the details to HRs. The HRs whom we mail often are not the same as visting or they do not check emails. So, text is a better option.</li>
  <li>Solve queries regarding dress code and conduct</li>
  <li>Prepare for your own placement and get rejected</li>
  <li>Reach the venue as SPOCs wont reach on time.</li>
  <li>Get the internet working</li>
  <li>Serve water and tell them where tea is.</li>
  <li>Be a pseudo SPOC for multiple companies till SPOCs turn up</li>

  <li>After 2 days, people give up. Encourage them to take it more positively</li>
  <li>Push HRs to do the following:
    <ul>
      <li>Allow Walkins</li>

    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Prepare lists for phase 2</li>
  <li>Make all video/audio interview happen if outside placement session</li>
  <li>Maybe get blamed if students do not perform well in DRS/P3. Counting that as occupational hazard.</li>
  <li>Phase 2 ?</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="suggestions-for-next-year">Suggestions for next year</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Unification of BDes and MDes placements</li>
  <li>A CC from IDC + 2-3 DPC. One IC from each should ideally carry on.</li>
  <li>Better communication with “legacy” companies</li>
  <li>Process should start early. Team join by April end and Work start by July 1st week</li>
  <li>Placement phase depends on BDes exchange timing.</li>
  <li>Best is to intimate companies before Nov about dates and have it ideally before 2nd week of Feb to avoid clashes with M.Des P3 Process</li>
  <li>Better division of work among all stakeholders- IDC DPCs, PMs, APCs and CCs</li>
  <li>A small training session for IDCians would be great. It should teach some niceties of interviewing and how not to be gullible.</li>
  <li>Japanese companies may be interested if, on-boarded early on</li>
  <li>An improved slotting should be possible to avoid job loss</li>
  <li>A placement team meet to introduce IDC DPCs/CC the process and people to contact as they usually end up bugging the PMs.</li>
  <li>Placement Session that educates students about the process and things to say and not to say.</li>
  <li>A category in type of companies as <em>Design</em> along with RnD/FMCG etc.</li>
  <li>SPOCs should report on time and send a greeting message whenever they are alloted the company.</li>
  <li>Automation of a lot of tasks like printing etc can be done from the portal.</li>
  <li>A separate section on the JAF filling portal for Design as usually companies complain that they cannot find the MDes or what to choose.</li>
  <li>Consider a paid placement for companies and free/reduced fee for students.</li>
  <li>Scrap the idea of two phase placements. They do not work as students loose interest, have too much work, DPCs academics get affected and may be scolded and rebuked by authorities.</li>
  <li>Smoothen the JAF verification process. It takes a lot of time to get JAFs verified.</li>
</ol>

<p>Best,</p>
