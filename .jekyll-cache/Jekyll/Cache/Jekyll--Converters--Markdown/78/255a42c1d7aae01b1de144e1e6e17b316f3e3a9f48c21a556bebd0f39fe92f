As they say that the depth is in the details. Details seem to take more time to consume. The lowering attention span is already a pandemic fueled by the many attention apps. Then there is all this things about reading 300 books a year and blah blah. You get that. The point is, being on the surface and consuming thing (podcasts, books, etc) does not leave time enough for that essential reflection to truly see the depth. Hence, what you know is what most peeps would after reading the same things. A dicussion with them is highly probably to be an echo chamber.</p>

<p><strong>Criminalisation of slowness</strong>
Most times and most things have to be done fast. Noone asks why? A fast food, Fast design (Design Thinking), Fast Code (Lean, Sprint, Agile) all lead to bad health. Details are lost. The society or the accelertionist environment of progress criminalises for slowly done jobs. Slack is punished and tasks are automated. As you gain time for being fast, the joy to task is not there. The immersion is super ficial. There is always a server or process to blame for the lack of joy in work. No wonder many fast jobs are no longer creative but are creativity served like fast food.Fast is largely a marketed trait and not a natural required one. Humans cannot be fast, we are slow animals. Remember the last time you were expecting fast. Was it at a home delivery ? Or was it running at the cost of not enjoying? Most of this ‘need for speed’ is actually not needed. Jon Cleese talks about it in the section on “Tortoise brain” and “Hare Brain”</p>

<p><strong>Pandemic, the small world, and slowness</strong>
Uff, the Pandemic. Many like me have realized the value to patience and stillness cultivated by slowness during the pandemic. As remote jobs or hybrid ones take over, the work was spread across zones. It is as if, the whole world is like a big unified time zone. You just have 8 hours to sleep in the small world of your cabin  you watch and work feverishly for the remaining time. Why? What is it to be done?  This led to a warp speed of cognitive consumption. Binging, swiping and what not. I remember asking a friend his recommendation for a TV show and when I asked why? He could hardly remember anything. He did leave a good review.</p>

<p>**Slowness and Learning **
I came up with this thought the other day. Many skills are best learned when we start slowly. Even with sports, If one is training to run for marathon, it is the ability to consistently run at slow speeds and save the boost for later. It does get very irritating as we seem to be too obsessed with speed, but my runner friend, Ben, always tells me to train to run for longer time than for longer distances. I guess, its the same when you learning music. The tempo is horribly slow, but that is, I guess, required for muscle memory to build up. One Ayurvedic dude I met at uni always used to say, we are very slow organisms. Things take a while to heal and change and most people give up or get irritated by slow progress.</p>
