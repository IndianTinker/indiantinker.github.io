<h3 id="criminalization-of-slowness">Criminalization of slowness</h3>

<p>Many times and many things have to be done fast. No one asks Why? (Why should be a crypto-currency, very scarce)</p>

<p>Fast food, Fast design (Design Thinking), Fast Code (Lean, Sprint, Agile) all lead to bad health, eventually.</p>

<p>Details are lost. There is no fun. The society or the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/11/accelerationism-how-a-fringe-philosophy-predicted-the-future-we-live-in">accelertionist</a> environment of progress criminalizes for slowly done work. <a href="https://fs.blog/2021/05/slack/">Slack</a> is punished and tasks are automated. As you gain time for being fast, the joy one gets from the task is not there. The immersion is superficial and checklist-y. There is always a server or process to blame for the lack of fun. No wonder many fast jobs are no longer creative but are creativity served like Big Mc Burger.</p>

<p>Fast, IMO, is largely a marketed trait and not a natural required one. Humans cannot be fast, we are slow animals. Remember the last time you were expecting something to be fast. Was it at a home delivery ? Or was it running at the cost of not enjoying? Most of this ‚Äòneed for speed‚Äô is actually not needed.</p>

<h3 id="need-for-speed-in-the-pandemic">Need for Speed in the pandemic</h3>

<p>As they say that the depth is in the details. Details seem to take more time to consume. The lowering attention span is already a pandemic fueled by the many attention kidnapping apps. Then there is all this things about reading 300 books a year, listening to 10x podcasts, and blah blah. You get that. The point is, being on the surface and consuming thing (podcasts, books, etc) does not leave time enough for that essential reflection to truly see the depth.</p>

<p>The pandemic seem to have increased this as well. As we all, lay trapped in a cabin, working and watching, there is a reinvention pressure. Binging to stay ahead of the netflix buffet seems to be quite high. Seldom do viewers pay attention to the way the shot has been composed and lately the directors have lost ‚Äòthat‚Äô cinematic attention (again IMO). Many friends watch shows for several seasons only to forget what they were about. They do give a good rating.</p>

<p>We run faster than the time it takes for the content to stick. It just grabs our attention. We dont seem to be more interesting because we dont know what we watched. Felt good, might think later :)</p>

<h3 id="slowness-and-learning">Slowness and Learning</h3>

<p>I came up with this thought the other day. Many skills are best learned when we start slowly. Like slow, SLOW. Even with sports, If one is training to run for marathon, it is the ability to consistently run at slow speeds and save the boost for later. It does get very irritating as we seem to be too obsessed with speed, but my runner friend, Ben üáÆüá™, always tells me to discipline myself to run for a longer time than for longer distances or lesser times. I guess, its the same when you learning music. The tempo is horribly slow, but that is, I guess, required for muscle memory to build up. (I have some thoughts on e-learning in this context but for another time)</p>

<p>John Cleese talks about it in the section of his book, <em>Creativity: A Short and Cheerful Guide</em> on ‚ÄúTortoise brain‚Äù and ‚ÄúHare Brain‚Äù. He largely attributes the Tortoise brain to unconscious processes and the Hare brain that gets things done.</p>

<p>So, there seem to be value in not being fast all the time and may be a bit of slow can help us all a bit. Slow is not lazy.</p>

<p>I do have a follow up article on some habit or rituals, I have been experimenting with to win back this slowness in life. I hope, I can edit that soon.</p>
