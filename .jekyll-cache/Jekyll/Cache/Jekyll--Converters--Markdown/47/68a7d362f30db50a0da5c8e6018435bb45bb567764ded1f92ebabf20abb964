I"±<p>I am now in process of migrating my main blog on <a href="http://indiantinker.wordpress.com">wordpress</a> to github pages for more contexual/design/layout freedom. This blog is built using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory [â€¦] and spits out a complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache or your favorite web server. This is also the engine behind GitHub Pages, which you can use to host your projectâ€™s page or blog right here from GitHub.</p>

<p>For those who have used <a href="http://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a> in the past Jekyll is excellent as it (personally saying) generates a static website by compiling all the code you wrote in the post.Obviously, with the luxury of <strong>platforms</strong> like wordpress,blogspot etc writing bare code is archaic. Jekyll has got your back here too, you never <em>write</em> the html/css tags from scratch. The Jekyll engine takes standard markdown which it builds into a html code and once built gives you a complete website. You an obviously code in html too.</p>

<p>Comments,widgets and Analytics work too with just a bit of playing required.
