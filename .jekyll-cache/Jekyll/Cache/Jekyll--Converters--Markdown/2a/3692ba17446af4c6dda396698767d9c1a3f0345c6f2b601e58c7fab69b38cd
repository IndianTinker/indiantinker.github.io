I"=<p><em>Zu ZU ZU ZU ZU UUUU ..BR.BR.CHIK</em> Thats how my old â€˜Phillips All in Oneâ€™ failed a couple of weeks back. It was a pretty archaic piece. All it could do was play Cassettes, Do Radio, Had an Aux In and offcourse the marketed <strong>CD Player with a segmented Display</strong>. But today most of the music is digital and hence <em>Upgrade was necessary</em>.</p>

<p>I was planning to buy one and browsing the estores but then then <em>Makers Dilemma</em> struck me.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Why Buy? When it can be Built!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And alas! I was fiddling with microcontrollers and SD Cards to make one. But couldnt get to the level i wanted. I wanted one that could:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Play MP3s</li>
  <li>Radio</li>
  <li>Aux -IN</li>
  <li>Take SD Cards</li>
  <li>Remotes will be good too.</li>
</ul>

<p>Fitting such things in a project would rather be heavenly. I searched online for references and <em>You have it boy!</em> there is one ready to amplify (supply) module from our friends in China that does it all . See <a href="http://www.dx.com/p/1-0-led-car-mp3-player-module-w-fm-usb-mini-usb-sd-remote-controller-black-12v-126115#.VGbgJ4X7sjg">this</a>  .</p>

<p>I had seen this in a Taxi (less formally called <em>Gramin Seva</em>) while commuting to college once, which made me realise that this would certainly be available in India. The next day i was in the market looking for it and I did source it for about 9 $ (INR 500 )</p>

<p>Now all i need to do is :</p>

<ol>
  <li>Decipher the connections</li>
  <li>Build a power supply and Amplifier</li>
  <li>Find/Repurpose/Build a 2-Component (1-Woof and 1-Tweeter) speaker box</li>
  <li>Modify the box to fit all in</li>
  <li>Enjoy</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Connections</strong> were pretty easy as the silkscreen had some references. It basically needs a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">5V DC</code> supply thatâ€™s the two pin connected on the left for and give <strong>stereo</strong> output using the 3 of 4 connectors on right (<em>Right, Left and GND</em>) and the last one is for the FM Antenna</p>

<p>The next part was testing if i will see the blue smoke of death as sometimes they can mess up with silkscreens too. <em>FingersCrossed</em></p>

<p>It worked fine and i was playing things off the USB straight away!</p>

<p>Now, the power supply and Amplifier. I used the omnipresent <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">7805 Regulator</code> that could power the module easily as i estimated the current requirements to be around <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">250-300mA</code> . The supply was going to be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">12VDC</code> due to the Amp i was building and hence, a heat sink was necessary.
The Amp was build out of <strong>STâ€™s</strong> <a href="http://www.st.com/st-web-ui/static/active/en/resource/technical/document/datasheet/CD00000128.pdf">TDA2030</a> which is a 14W,voltage friendly, High Fidelity (Correct Portrayl of sound without much loss in clarity), Class AB , Mono Amplifier.</p>

<p>The Application circuit works charm.
So, i assembled them on a single perfboard and was short of one heat sink. I now had to decide. Who needs the heat sink badly?</p>

<p>Demo runs showed <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TDA2030</code> needs it badly. Now using some thermal glue and nuts and bolts i screwed the heatsink to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TDA2030</code> and made a makeshift heat sink for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">7805</code></p>

<p>I heard a strange buzz sometimes in the background which was because of some filtering issues. Adding a snubber (filter) for AC frequencies (50Hz) that was almost gone. Used the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">10k</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0.1uF</code> combination.</p>

<p>I had an Old but dis functional Column 2 component speaker, we had bought probably 12 years down the line. It was the ideal candidate for the purpose. Now opening and digging i found phenolic pcb with broken and corroded traces. I reworked them and the Woofer was working . (<em>Oh! Yeah</em>)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/15767875046" title="Look at that Woofer by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7520/15767875046_cb19326b8c_z.jpg" width="359" height="640" alt="Look at that Woofer" /></a></p>

<p>I planned to fit the circuit inside the speaker box itself. For that i had to cut a small square pocket in the body for the module to peep out and the other electronics would be inside it.</p>

<p>This was a bit more difficult than anticipated. After 2 hours and 2 broken saw blades , I was able to do this.</p>

<p>Now it was assembling time.</p>

<p>After a few half hours, i got it all working.. No Buzz and all music!</p>
