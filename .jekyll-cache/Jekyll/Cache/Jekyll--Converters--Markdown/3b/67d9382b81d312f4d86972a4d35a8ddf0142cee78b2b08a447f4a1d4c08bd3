<p>Let us make dancing passwords !</p>

<p>It was a funny moment when I and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/rishabhmakes">Rishabh</a> decided to participate in this hackathon. Designers in an engineering hackathon. I packed all my electronics in a bag, I got at another hackathon and reported at the venue. It was though to decide what to make.</p>

<p>Boredom struck us hard and we decided to make something that you could use to dance and operate the computer. Dance moves as a password? It was pretty random. Wishful thinking, of sorts.</p>

<p>We started working on a mat kind of a thing that one could place under his/her feet when using a computer. Hopping on it, one could do some moves to login. The mat would double up as a foot controller to operate websites like Youtube to do things like- play/pause, volume +/- and next/prev. We even built a chrome app for that. The whole thing was driven by an Arduino Leonardo acting happily as a  USB-Keyboard.</p>
