<p>I wake up the dawn, <br />
from its quiet shambles.<br />
Like a wanderer on road,<br />
With his screechy corners.</p>

<p>The world lays lost,<br />
in the dreams they believe .<br />
I sit there awake,<br />
dreaming to believe.</p>

<p>The wind i feel,<br />
sweeps me away.<br />
In its gusts it follows me,<br />
To the worlds i never foray.</p>

<p>Sometimes i feel,<br />
I should have said.<br />
Those words i had,<br />
she might have read.</p>

<p>May be it was a sad,<br />
that those winds never blew.<br />
May be it was great,<br />
those things i never drew.</p>

<p>There will be a dawn soon,<br />
to help us with the light.<br />
To give us all the hope,<br />
and bless us with the might.</p>

<p>Until that dawn,<br />
I have to wait.<br />
Search in the world,<br />
and try my fate.</p>

<p>A day may come,<br />
when I wake the dawn.<br />
Welcoming a new world,<br />
Then I shall carry-on.</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>

<p>Rohit</p>
