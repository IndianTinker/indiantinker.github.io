        ConnectNeXt App Ecosystem
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">03 Apr 2016</span>

    <blockquote>
  <p>This post describes the work done during my time at Tata Motors Research Center in Pune. I worked as an Assistant Manager in Human Machine Interface department. I was a project lead for this project from my team. Here, I present my work on designing and testing the initial release of Tata Motors ConnectNeXt App Ecosystem.  Work in the post was done between 2015-Q1 2016. I was involved in system design, testing, and user evaluation.</p>

<h4>Context</h4>
<p>This is 2014, Vehicle infotainment systems are getting more and more computation heavy. The customer demands more connection and driving needs to be data-informed (driven). The competition has some derived solutions in the market. We needed to respond by building our own contextual telematics ecosystem. I was involved as a Lead from PAT side in the project when the dev and design already had some ideas and had some prototypes being tested. My task was to rethink and improve the project- ConnectNeXt, from a user-centric point of view.  It is one of those projects, you are on the team and have to fight for the user. Then not be lured by the cool technology that could possibly take too much attention while driving. Not making an App need attention was the task. Android auto was still very new.</p>

<h4>Work</h4>
<p>I worked with many designs and dev teams (across 3 companies) in my role as a design integrator for the project. We studied the designed screen and flows. We did reviews of iconography, typography, and information architecture. Nitpicking things and presenting the user’s point was the goal. There were experiments to make apps that would adjust the visuals to the time of the day. The interaction points in the app were designed to be operated in a road filled with potholes. We simulated this condition using a torture track. This helped us move critical/decision points outside the primary interface. We researched about in-vehicle safety. Safety is at the top while using such apps in vehicles. With some benchmarking data, our user studies, and simulations, we designed some rough guidelines for vehicle-based apps on TML platform.  The idea was to have a central app that auto-configures based on the vehicle it is connected. The app would suggest possible compatible apps from the ecosystem. Then, it configures them. This is the connectNeXt app. About 150+ use cases were to be designed, implemented, and tested. Once the interface layer of these apps was sorted as a system, we moved on scoping the feature matrix. The entire operation was based on the Smartlink protocol stack, and hence we worked with a lot of connection, reconnection, and disconnection use cases over Bluetooth and/or USB.  All these apps are now in playstore.</p>

<h4>Learnings</h4>
<p>This was one of the things, I am kind of proud of. A lot of things come to light when thinking as the process. The API calls, UI layers, car data, user privacy, variable in a car, no internet, failure cases, and finally edge cases. I learned things like JIRA, App Ecosystem, CAN Tools, Vehicle Diagnostics, Vehicle safety, process maps, and doing projects with a lot of different stakeholders. The testing part of the project was fun. Initially, we were all communicating by logging bugs in JIRA. I did not even know people by their faces, just by their JIRA user names. But later, It was getting difficult to explain some very typical use cases. So, we decided on doing extensive all day collaboration drives with stakeholders. I used to drive in Pune and neighboring cities. We were logging data and simulating events, with the app developer and infotainment developers sitting in the car. They were initially scared of sitting in a camouflaged car. But, we were fixing more than 20+ bugs a day. I won an award for my work with the project too.</p>

<h4>How it affected the company</h4>
<p>I feel, it laid the foundations of what connectneXt is today. The company position transformed from being competitive in the market to become market leaders. The best part was all the tech and design was in-house and the company can virtually do anything the customer needs without sticking to the excel-sheet approach of many suppliers.</p>

        Augmenting Reality with Visiting Cards
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">19 Mar 2016</span>

    <p>Augmented Reality? Virtual Reality? Reality Intervention? Such Reality, Much Wow!</p>

<p>We humans have always had the craving for <em>not-so-real</em> things. Books, Theatre, Movies embody the idea and use various mediums to present the cooked up reality. But the keyword <strong>Personal</strong> is IN. This word also has its own story whose value has decreased from the time of Personal Chauffeur to Uber. We now consume reality personally.</p>

<p>So, instead of Tony,the Iron Man acting the same way for a billion earth inhabitants, we want him to be personal. Some don’t want him to hit the Hulk, some want him to probably not drive the R8 and rather drive the Lamborghini (I vehemently disagree to this one) .</p>

<p>So, the crux is mediums are becoming personal and so is their content. Things will happen this way as these <em>“Things”</em> are getting more affordable.</p>

<p>This time I thought of making some sense of the Augmented Reality. 
With the growing trend of things that seem real but are not, I present to you ladies and gentlemen the <strong>AR Cards</strong>.
These cards are basically pumped up visiting cards that enable users to project 3D models of their products/creations on their business cards using a Phone that has a camera. They can explain things in depth by moving the cards or phone relative to each other. I made one for myself with my favourite car , <em>Chevy Camaro</em> on it.</p>

<p>I also added some value to the Vcard by adding a scale to measure things. I kind of like <a href="/2016/01/01/MakersRule/">scales</a>. There is the usual QR code.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/25270472733/in/dateposted-public/" title="Front Side with a usable scale"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1639/25270472733_53bae50a27_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Front Side with a usable scale" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>On the back we have the <em>marker</em> that is used by the App to gauge the position and orientation of the object to be placed. The marker is at an offset, so that makes enough space for a note which we usually scribble on the card <em>somewhere</em>. Now that somewhere as a space for it.</p>

        ReactorX- The Arc Reactor from the movies
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">12 Mar 2016</span>

    <p>Who does not like Iron Man? Who does not like to be like him? I wanted to do a gig at the ComicCon Delhi a while back and who else could i be, the <em>Iron Man</em>. He is fundamentally the coolest engineer/maker around, at-least in the movies.</p>

<p>The defining thing with Iron Man is his “Arc Reactor” ; it gives him strength and he <em>made</em> it himself (Sorry Ivan Vanko). Obviously, to impersonate him, I would need one. So, I decided to build one using our friendly of-the-shelf micro-controller, the MSP430. I called it the ArcReactorX. (Probably because I like X-men too)</p>

<p>The arcReactorX is a wearable arc reactor clone which runs on a Li-Ion Battery from an old cell phone! It has 8 Blue LEDs on the circumference and a bright white LED in the centre.</p>

<p>Features:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Small and light</li>
  <li>Power efficient</li>
  <li>Bright</li>
  <li>Change-able modes using a switch</li>
  <li>Since, it has a battery, we need a battery indicator like a dial on the reactor.So if its 50% charged we light up only half of it. Follow the discharge graphs for more accuracy!</li>
  <li>Morse Code for SOS</li>
  <li>A mind blowing start-up sequence</li>
  <li>Knight rider effect on LEDs</li>
  <li>Breathing effect on the Middle high power LED</li>
</ul>

<p>It also needs to be wearable and comfortable at the same time.</p>

<p>The motion and the light helps attract attention.</p>

<p>I designed, etched and soldered the board around a TSSOP MSP430G2452. Complete and elaborate logs available on my <a href="https://hackaday.io/rohit">hackaday.io</a> profile.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/3053731397417432067.jpg" alt="Board" />
<img src="https://cdn.hackaday.io/images/6659031397312403141.jpg" alt="Board soldered" /></p>

<p>Added a test-code for the start-up sequence, i.e. when you turn it on for the first time</p>

<iframe width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HKzWJtDY-tM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>I added a velcro based strap on so i can just strap the reactor on my Tshirt and then wear another one on the top to hide it and turn it on.</p>

<p><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2862/13887143286_a6dc1ed901.jpg" alt="Wearable" /></p>

<p>The TL-DR; video is here (please pardon me for the weird psychedelic audio) :</p>

<iframe width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NbuMJwMDaMo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
