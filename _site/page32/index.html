        Open Agitator
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">07 Apr 2014</span>

    <p>After a somewhat woeful week at college that shook my belief in several sectors.. I mustered up my courage to realize an old project they knocked the door every time i used to Etch PCB boards. Since, the solution i use has already done close to 20 boards of small size one has to really keep shaking/stirring/Agitating the solution for a fairy long time.. ( ya 7-8 mins of man power is fairly long time :P )</p>

<p>The idea came to me when i visited my brother in <a title="Travelogue: Bangalore" href="http://indiantinker.wordpress.com/2013/05/24/travelogue-bangalore/" target="_blank">Bangalore</a> earlier this year. He was generous enough to give us a tour of his world class Biotechnology lab in India.. He showed us stuff and things/instruments which were difficult to pronounce in one go but they all had a thing in common- They ended with syllables like -<em>‘-izer’,-‘ator’,’-ation’. </em></p>

<p>One thing that they used for not allowing things/particles to sediment was called a shaker. It would be great if i could get one for myself that will take the work out of etching. When i returned i made an over-killed 3D model of the agitator that i had in mind. It would just be a 1-axis CNC with a stepper motor and belt, That was doing a lot for the task..</p>

<p>Here are some pics of the model:</p>

<p><a href="http://indiantinker.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/etchinator2.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-488" alt="Looks Cool Though.. " src="http://indiantinker.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/etchinator2.jpg" width="570" height="514" /></a> Looks Cool Though..</p>

<p><a href="http://indiantinker.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/etchinator1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-487" alt="Freewheel mount and stepper motor" src="http://indiantinker.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/etchinator1.jpg" width="633" height="466" /></a> Freewheel mount and stepper motor</p>

<p>Realizing the overkill design, I went on to an easier one earlier this month ( actually previous month ) when a relative who was ‘demolishing’ his old PC gave me some old CDROMs that didn`t work. The mechanics did work though..</p>

<p>So, I just ‘damaged’ the tracks around the main feed motor and attached my own custom circuit based around the MSP430 micro-controller and majority of TI parts as they can be shipped to anyone  with an address making it very easy to re build yourself.</p>

<p>Here is a proof-of-concept video i posted a while back where the Etchinator ( now Open Agitator after i realized it could do a lot more like cooling hot milk  :D ) was etching its own control board  :</p>

<iframe width="640" height="480" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/wOFcjrQe-is" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>I used a L293D H bridge motor controller to control the forward and backward movement of the cradle with an adjustable speed by giving a PWM on the Enable Pin . People who had made LFR’s in the first/second year know its a child`s play.</p>

<p>After running the aforementioned set up for a while i noticed that  the cradle would shift to the farther end where the gear was slightly worn out. So, when loaded the cradle would :</p>

<ol>
  <li>Latch on to that part and stay stuck.</li>
  <li>The whole system would move a bit forward each time and latch on the wrong part.</li>
</ol>

<p>So, an end-stop detection was required which would keep the cradle in the fixed portion.. some what similar to the ones i had seen in the CNC`s which tell them their legitimate playing fields.</p>

<p>The answer was using the old mouse push button that came with the CD-ROM. Its softer and probably made to withstand greater number of press-cycles than a standard SPST Tactile switch.</p>

<p>So , now the logic would work like, whenever the button/EndStop is pressed, the direction will be reversed for a fixed time and then reversed again.. So, the cycle keeps on going.. .. .. ..</p>

<p>Here is the final  schematic i came up with:</p>

<p><a href="http://indiantinker.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/sche.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-492" alt="Schematic" src="http://indiantinker.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/sche.png" width="700" height="482" /></a> Schematic</p>

<p>Since, i did’nt wanted to leave any pins un-used i included 3 LED`s which show the different states of the agitator.</p>

<p>The power supply needs special mention as it converts from a standard 12V DC adapter to 5V for the logic of the bridge (L293D) and again an <a href="http://www.ti.com/product/lp2950-33" target="_blank">LDO LP2950-3.3V</a> for the MSP430. The LDO can be sampled from TI and 7805 is available locally with every tinkerer.</p>

<p>Even the driver i.e <a href="http://www.ti.com/product/l293d" target="_blank">L293D</a> can be sourced from Ti. The brain of the device is a <a href="http://www.ti.com/product/msp430g2231" target="_blank">MSP430G2231</a> also sampled from TI and programmed from the <a href="http://www.ti.com/tool/msp-exp430g2" target="_blank">MSP430 Launchpad</a>. So, This project was indirectly sponsored by TI :D</p>

<p>The next came the board layout.. I designed it to have the least number of  vias (They can be a pain sometimes) while fitting at the back of the CD-ROM. Here is the one with just two vias.</p>

<p><a href="http://indiantinker.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/brd.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-493" alt="Board!" src="http://indiantinker.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/brd.png" width="458" height="205" /></a> Board</p>

<p>Since, the position of motor/EndStop switches were flexible they eased out the routing a bit. You can also add a DC Jack to it if you like. The files are available on github <a href="https://github.com/IndianTinker/OpenAgitator" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>Here are pictures of the final build i managed to pull off.</p>

<p><a href="http://indiantinker.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/dsc00522.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-497" alt="The EndStop" src="http://indiantinker.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/dsc00522.jpg" width="700" height="525" /></a> The EndStop</p>

<p><a href="http://indiantinker.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/dsc00521.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-503" alt="Fixed to the back of the CDROM" src="http://indiantinker.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/dsc00521.jpg" width="700" height="525" /></a> Fixed to the back of the CDROM</p>

<p>The next thing that was left was to give it a sturdy base. I choose two planks of wood that were lying around. It was essential to leave it without any base on the middle section as if ‘ever’ there is a chemical spill that can be cleaned without unscrewing the entire assembly!</p>

<p>So, Here is the final build :</p>

<p><a href="http://indiantinker.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/dsc00520.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-502" alt="Final Build" src="http://indiantinker.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/dsc00520.jpg" width="700" height="525" /></a> Final Build</p>

<p>You can fork the complete code and design from my<a href="https://github.com/IndianTinker/OpenAgitator" target="_blank"> github repo</a>.</p>

<p>Here is a video of me explaining the build.. Please ignore the following :</p>
<ul>
	<li>Bad camera quality</li>
	<li>Some goof-ups with the IC names.. Keep an eye on the Sub Titles/Captions</li>
	<li>Background Noise (if any)</li>
</ul>

<p>Hope you like it and build one for yourself..

<h4>Context</h4>
<p>Ten engineers passionate about making a robust vehicle that runs long distances on solar electric energy.  With almost no funds and no technical expertise in any areas on designing a car, we had to make a path of our own, amidst no support from industry.</p>

<h4>Work</h4>
<p>I was selected in the team in my first year. It was a cool feeling. We had to showcase the car and drive 3000km across Australia (Darwin—Adelaide). No amount of background is enough for the project, but I will try to keep it as concise as possible. In the initial year, I was responsible for working on telemetry and solar array fabrication of the car. I was a somehow a self-made in-charge of designing the logo, brochure, and posters for the car too. I still don’t know why did I choose those batman fonts. I guess we all are naive at some stage. The first car building was entirely funded by our college and ourselves. It was launched by the Chief Minister of the state and we received a lot of good reviews for our sleepless nights and misadventures. I had documented the process in my old blog. The stages were :</p>

<p>Our goal was to learn how to make a car that runs on solar power. We built, failed, burned, and rebuilt our own converters and circuits. Learned by doing and breaking things. Our hands were always dirty and mind always busy solving some problems.  Finally, we did build a working car, certified to run on international roads.  The race in Australia was great. We had the lowest cost car in the competition. Or we did not know why things could be so expensive. The cost of competing was more than the cost of building the car for us. The rough estimate is about 10 times cheaper. We did complete the race, but our mileage was about 11%. Crossing the line mattered a lot to us, sweating it out to learn and without support from the industry. We built a parent-sourced car.  In the next year, we decided to build a more utilitarian passenger car. Our previous failures helped us and we were able to build one in record time. This time we used curved panels adapted to our body too. We learned this from friends from Germany, Singapore, and Iran while in Australia. The current car drew more attention and was inaugurated by the President of India, Pranab Mukherjee. It was faster and a bit conventional. I hope we furthered the thinking in this space with our work. In the end, we moved out of the team and the juniors carried it on. Some of the people in the team now work for good automotive companies like Tesla, Tata Motors, Hero, and Google.</p>

<p><strong>Learnings</strong>: The learnings were immense. We traveled to Australia and camped in deserts, in forests and wherever we stopped. I have tons of stories to tell about these things. We had to manage a lot of finances ourselves. So, we learned cost analysis down to the component level. I learned a lot on DIY, making, and electronics in general. This helped me with my hobbies and work under Prof. Gadre. The experience made me realize the value of working in a team. We all slogged and made it through.</p>

        Ahemdabad Che!

    <span class="post-date">31 Mar 2014</span>

    <p>Gujrati Food.. Umm .If you love gujrati food in which ever part of the country you are and then go and visit Ahmadabad for some reason and eat those “Jalebi, Fafda” or Khandvi, I bet your entire “Gujrati Food here(at your place) is good” notion will be changed and you will abstain from eating Gujju Food anywhere else. It has been Months and i haven’t eaten my favorite Khandvi. Its also so pirated here in Delhi. Well.. Food Piracy !</p>

<p>In this travelogue I will go through my adventurous journey into the food and people of Amdavad (as they say there). We were recently there for <a title="MakerFest 2014" href="http://indiantinker.wordpress.com/2014/01/25/makerfest-2014-roundup/" target="_blank">MakerFest </a> and in whatever time we got I and my group consisting Of Ishan and Saral sneaked into the city to explore be it late night (1am-ish) or early morning! What i am going to illustrate was done in bits and pieces , but surprisingly can be done in one full day! So, the below log can be done chronologically but was done in 2 days due to other important tasks :)</p>

<p>We were based out of Nehru Nagar. So most delicious shops were located nearby. If you plan to roam around next day, try eating something light in dinner as the next day will be “Heavy” .</p>

<p>We woke a early( well 10:30am it was i guess) and reached the famous ‘<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Juna+Sherbazar/@23.0218518,72.5432173,21z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x5a8ad26931ddbf1c" target="_blank">Juna Sherbazaarwalla</a>’ for his jalebi fafda combo. Fafda is made out of besan and is usually eaten with green chillis. But imagine if you combine the three. Its an atomic combination, Sweet, salty and spicy -3S ! We saw a local person, on the road sitting on his 80’s Lambeda Scooter and savoring Kadhi also along with 3S’s . So we ordered it too. And it added more ammo to the stuff. Kadhi was a bit sweeter and less salty. We ended up ordering Dhokla too.</p>

<p><a title="Best Jalebi in town by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/11982146306"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7424/11982146306_2a074daeb6.jpg" alt="Best Jalebi in town" width="500" height="281" /></a>
<a title="Yum! by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/11981303585"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5527/11981303585_4c160bf0a3_b.jpg" alt="Yum!" width="1024" height="575" /></a>The best algo is Jalebi in one hand and fafda in another and then dip fafda in kadhi and eat the jalebi first and then fafda. Loop until you drop!</p>

<p>I dont like spices a lot. So, i avoided the chillis. Ishan loved it and posed for it.</p>

<p><a title="Bas kar! by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/11981275295"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3666/11981275295_cdaecc9e8c.jpg" alt="Bas kar!" width="500" height="281" /></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>I browsed the shop and found some other interesting stuff as well. <em>Jee Lalchaye Raha na jaye</em>
<a title="Make that 4 by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/11981701944"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7420/11981701944_2f112e3cd5.jpg" alt="Make that 4" width="500" height="281" /></a></p>

<p><a title="Ji Lalchahe Raha na jaye! by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/11981595643"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5534/11981595643_549dfc391d.jpg" alt="Ji Lalchahe Raha na jaye!" width="500" height="281" /></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>They were basically all dhokla’s and Samosa but a bit sweeter and nice. Not to say we tasted them as well. We were fortunate enough to be in Gujrat at the time of Uttaran which is when you can get the famous Undio (Dish) and see Gujrat in its full colors.</p>

<p><a title="Round 3 by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/11981675694"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7430/11981675694_5d0c133bd0.jpg" alt="Round 3" width="500" height="281" /></a></p>

<p>Next we moved to <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Das+Khaman+House/@23.021278,72.543526,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x395e84dc3fffffff:0x8df081f249aca5ed" target="_blank">The Khaman Shop</a>! On the same road as Juna Sharebazaar walla , but a little further. Khaman is similar to Dhokla. But I couldn’t understand whats the difference.</p>

<p><a title="The Khaman Shop by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/11981613945"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2850/11981613945_d743dfe220.jpg" alt="The Khaman Shop" width="500" height="281" /></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>The Undio is basically a very spicy but tasty vegetable dish. It contains a lot of oil (I dont know why). But it was very tasty. It had Potatoes,Coriander and lot of other veggies i dont remember. Avoid this is you hate Oil and Chilly.
<a title="Undio by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/11981253235"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3679/11981253235_963fe66719.jpg" alt="Undio" width="500" height="281" /></a>Then we had the Khaman. It was just Awwwwesome! There was a nice tinge of garlic and sweetness i haven’t noticed anywhere. There is also a female version of Khaman called Khamani. Its a bit more crunchy and Spicy.It has tasty besan bhujia sprinkled over it and served with yellow chutney. Yummy..</p>

<p>PS: Just before you start suspecting me of over-eating. This was eaten by a group of 3 :P</p>

<p>With our input buffer almost full. We couldn’t order full plates of stuff we saw in the shop and were happily obliged by the shop owner who gave us some taste samples!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/11981609385"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7359/11981609385_c75dd5c739.jpg" alt="Taste Samples- Dhokla,Khandvi and Barfi Dhokla" width="500" height="281" /></a> Yellow- Khandvi, White-Green- Dhokla, White-Barfi Dhokla</p>

<p>The shop has almost 20 Different types of Dhoklas. Wow!</p>

<p>Since, our stomachs needed some rest. We needed to sneak out to some place of fun and walk.We headed on to <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kankaria+Lake/@23.006353,72.6018539,18z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x395e85c51048cefb:0x777f51782a8b7a1a" target="_blank">Kankaria Lake</a>. As always, prefer Local BRTS which is quite an efficient way to go around the city. Public Transport is always better.</p>

<p><a title="Kankaria Lake by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/11982381816"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7415/11982381816_70bb895550.jpg" alt="Kankaria Lake" width="500" height="281" /></a>The lake is a pretty huge one, with a lot of things around it like Toy Train around the circumference, Fish Museum , Eating Stalls,Speed Boating, A Hot Air Balloon Ride,Kids in plastic balls that dont sink ( I dont know what its called :) ) and a ATV track with Polaris quads meant for kids below 12 ( :/ )</p>

<p>Train Ride was pretty good. Good ‘ol Days as kids were revisited. Beware the Train Driver can yell at you if you get off the running train.It doesnt go over 12kmph.So, we did got over at Fish Museum. Hahaha.. DONT TRY THIS!</p>

<p>The Fish Museum  was pretty nice. Its a two floor museum with lots of different fishes on display.I dont eat fishes (Vegetarian) and don’t know many fish names other than Piranha ( Piranha 3D :P ) , gold fish ( Childhood stories), Sharks (Jaws) and Turtles. All of them were present there. Happy to meet you in person guys! We also did a little experiment to see if fishes react to Jazz Music. Conclusion: Well Some do, Some Don’t!</p>

<p>After our input buffer almost empty, we though of eating ; Whats better than Vada Pav. We ordered Vada Pav at the local stall on the lake! It was pretty bad. Some famous person has said, “ Chilli is the mask of a bad cook” . The Vada Pav was filled with Chilli. This is a pretty old street food trick when they sell water/drinks by selling spicy food. Busted!</p>

<p>We then had some ice-cream from the “What-we-thought-local” shop called Havmor. But it was some real bang on buck. Totally awesome! There was no Kwality Walls, Cream Bell or Mother Dairy there but Havmor was infact a chain of Ice-Cream Parlors Spread across city.The Raja–Rani flavor ice cream is pretty good, just in case you have trouble choosing.</p>

<p>It was now time to leave this pleasant lake and move to some godly place. ISKCON Temple was the place. There is a bus stand outside Kankaria Lake and you can get direct bus to ISKCON Temple. We passed over the Sabarmati Lake front and captured this beautiful sunset.</p>

<p><a href="http://indiantinker.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/wp_20140106_034.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-632" src="http://indiantinker.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/wp_20140106_034.jpg" alt="WP_20140106_034" width="700" height="393" /></a></p>

<p>It took us quite a while to reach there. People were happy to help us when we wanted. Good People always smiling! We reached ISKCON Temple near the time of arti and as always the ISKCON Temple Arti is pretty hair raising! We paid our tribute to Lord Krishna and stayed there for a while. Bliss!</p>

<p>Then after the ARTI was over, we had the prasad and went outside, collected our shoes and ate chinese samosas. This is a pretty standard ‘delicacy’ in any Indian Marriage. Its basically a Indianized Fried Wonton and is served with Momo Sauce. Still better than that Vada Pav!</p>

<p>The Question was now what? Go to the BaseCamp or Go somewhere else? Obviously Go somewhere else, But where? We were suggested by a person to do visit the “Drive-In Cinema” . Its probably there in two Indian cities Mumbai and Ahemdabad. So, why not! Bus Route is way out of question suggested Here Drive. We took the Auto to “Drive In Cinema”. It basically a place where you can Drive into a large ground with your car and watch the movie out of the car itself. The Screen was huuuuuggggeee ! Dhoom-3 was being played. We joined in. Its a great experience but even if you dont have a car, there is a small auditorium built near the projection room that can accommodate you!
<a title="Drive in Cinema by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/11981563745"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3778/11981563745_16f680d9bd.jpg" alt="Drive in Cinema" width="500" height="281" /></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>There were small poles with built in speaker and Amps too, because if they had a central amp, then those long wires load the central amp a lot.</p>

<p>We enjoyed the movie and had “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dabeli" target="_blank">Dabeli</a>” during the interval. It was way better than that Vada Pao and Standard Pop Corn. Its a type of Vada Pao only but a bit different.I guess they dont use Besan in the tikki/vada they have inside it. Prefer a butter Dabeli if you have an option.Below is the picture captured when the butter was smoked.</p>

<p><a title="Dabeli by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/11981869243"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3696/11981869243_cf98177a93_b.jpg" alt="Dabeli" width="1024" height="575" /></a></p>

<p>It was a bit spicy, but the chutney neutralized some of it. But the time the movie was over. We were hungry! Damm Hungry. We took an auto to Nehru Circle. It was 10pm so night charges apply! We asked the auto person to drop us off the circle as well. We found another good shop!</p>

<p>It served the best Vada Pao and Khasta Samosa Ever!</p>

<p><a title="The Best Vada Pao in Town by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/11981666803"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3728/11981666803_b85b29bf4a.jpg" alt="The Best Vada Pao in Town" width="500" height="281" /></a></p>

<p>The shop owner was a pretty nice lad. He was from Rajasthan and was very much patriotic about Gujrat and kept on repeating “<em>Aap humare Gujrat mein aaye ho</em>”. When asked about NaMo his words were sweeter than the Jalebi we had in the morning.</p>

<p>We ate Vada Pao and Samosa! The Vada Pao ( i am a fan boy of ) was a bit different than the one i had in Dadar,Mumbai near Siddhivinyak which is rather advertorial to be the best in Mumbai. It was spicy but good but this one was the best! 10/10 . When asked about the secret, he said he has a special chutney which uses Khumani (I guess). If you love Vada Pao go here! Its near Nehru Circle and opens till late!
<a title="Vada Pao by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/11981362555"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7310/11981362555_e8a0ab9e0c.jpg" alt="Vada Pao" width="500" height="281" /></a></p>

<p><a title="Samosa by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/11980933665"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7293/11980933665_e34f63ffba.jpg" alt="Samosa" width="500" height="281" /></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>The samosa was also good. But it was the chutney that had all the magic!</p>

<p>Next we moved to a Pizza Shop-Real Paparika. Unlike Dominoes or Pizza Hut in Delhi, Amdavad has a lot of there joints which are essentially home-grown Italian Food Chains. Since we were half full, so we ordered the 4 pizza Combo! Surprisingly they have an unlimited food combo for 129 INR.
<a title="Late Night Pizza by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/11981862673"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7401/11981862673_06a6a1142c.jpg" alt="Late Night Pizza" width="500" height="281" /></a></p>

<p>Well the pizza was good. But not surprising.It was comparable in quality to Dominoes and far well prepared but was pretty basic! Next we moved to the local soda parlor to have some late night soda! The soda shop had a chach flavored soda that was worth trying.</p>

<p><a title="Soda by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/11981758264"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3796/11981758264_ef93326923.jpg" alt="Soda" width="500" height="281" /></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>As we drank the soda , we could see city getting ready for Uttarayan. Kite thread ( Manja) was being glazed with glass and various different kites were being made.Too bad we wont be in the city on the day! But there is always a next time.
<a title="Manja by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/11981251753"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7364/11981251753_045f4d54e7.jpg" alt="Manja" width="281" height="500" /></a></p>

<p><a title="Sada Haq Aithe Rakh Patang by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/11981334655"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2821/11981334655_ac0464cb28.jpg" alt="Sada Haq Aithe Rakh Patang" width="281" height="500" /></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>As we were walking towards our apartment, we thought about various things, the people’s love for the city, NaMo, Food and It was never a bad time for some late night ice cream. Ice Cream anyone?
<a title="Havmor Ice Cream by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/11981463926"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7368/11981463926_dfb293092c.jpg" alt="Havmor Ice Cream" width="281" height="500" /></a></p>

<p> </p>

<p>Cheers,</p>
