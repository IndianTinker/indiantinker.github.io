        MacroCASE- A DIY phone case to see, up close !
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">26 Feb 2015</span>

    <p><em>A detailed build procedure of this is already posted on <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/MacroCase-A-DIY-Phone-Case-for-Macro-Photography/">Instructables</a></em></p>

<p>Last night while I was soldering a TSSOP Package on a home-etched board, i found it really difficult to see the joints whether they had soldered fine or whether i had a healthy track? I used my eye-loupe to see up close.The idea of using eye-loupe was initially introduced to my while my time at <em>CEPD,NSIT</em> .Ah! That was a beautiful solder joint. Something worth saving and sharing. So, I just held the loupe in front of the phone to click a picture and save it. I figured this could be useful in taking macroshots too. 
umm.. Like this bajra seed</p>

<p>These instances started to occour more frequently. You know the feeling when you figure out that one <strong>Juggad</strong> has solved a problem and you keep on using it again and again. Sometimes, even when not quite necessary (But for fun!)</p>

<p>So, why not combine the phone and this eye-loupe (sadly but aptly broken due to its relocation from Delhi) and make something permanent and then the <em>MACROCase</em> was made and it gave purpose to that ready to throw back cover that i just made useful.</p>

<p>You wont need much stuff to make it, just almost everything in the picture below is enough.
<img src="http://cdn.instructables.com/F74/UVMV/I5J54C54/F74UVMVI5J54C54.MEDIUM.jpg" /></p>

<p>Building is not very difficult (See this <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/MacroCase-A-DIY-Phone-Case-for-Macro-Photography/">Instructable</a>). I also added a LED to precisely illuminate the scene just in case we went up too close. An assorted SMD switch was added near the camera button (Yes some Lumias have it :P). The whole wiring was done using copper tape. One can also use the wires. I preffered them as they are just stick.</p>

<p>And there I have my own modded phone case that helps me take nice pictures of the smaller things in life and help me pick numbers of those small components like resistors and chips.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for an upcoming tutorial series on umm.. Lets keep it a secret till then. ! Until next time, (as John Green says) ,  Dont Forget to be awesome!</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>

      <a href="/2015/01/17/Makerfest/">
        MakerFest 2015 Ahe !
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">17 Jan 2015</span>

    <p>Lets start with my amateurish <em>Haiku</em></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Dusty days and chilly Nights
<br />Curious<br />Lets celebrate Making !</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>(Apologies)</strong></p>

<p>Ah! Makerfest 2014 at NID, Ahmedabad was super awesome. When i saw a notification for applications in my feed one fine day. I had to apply. I decided to give a small <em>Getting Started with MSP430</em> workshop at MakerFest. Plus it would be a great time to refresh some memories( rather taste buds) from last year. Ahmedabad is quite reachable from Pune. It takes about 8-9 hrs by Duronto and 12-13 hours via bus. I decided to go via bus and return with whatever seems convenient.</p>

<p>Unlike last year, this time around Makerfest was present at CEPT . Whenever i got some free time,i did explore the campus which has various installations by students and some funny (rather intriguing) posters .</p>

<p>As always, i did reach a day in advance. The first (pre) day we had a workshop at <strong>IIM - A</strong> . My Chaotic bus provider didn’t try hard enough to make it on time and I entered the session with about 25% left. It was a good time to visit the campus though.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/16287907815" title="IIM A &lt;3 by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8644/16287907815_463a3e8e40_z.jpg" width="640" height="359" alt="IIM A &lt;3" /></a></p>

<p>Somehow we couldn’t find our way exploring the campus on ourselves, So I called my friend <em>Miteshwar</em> who studies here to help us out. Glad he could make out of his busy schedule and give a trip around the beautiful campus. My phone died , and i didn’t click pictures of the old campus. But those of you who have seen <strong>2 states</strong> ; Guys, its the same, but seems so great in real!</p>

<p>I found this unusual contraption on most 2 wheelers around Ahmedabad. Curious, I asked a passer by who explains:</p>

<p><em>During the kite festival, the city is almost covered with kites and numerous number of kites are given freedom (thread-cut) every moment.They carry with them a meticulously sharpened thread which has caused road accidents and even severed some necks of two-wheeler riders.</em></p>

<p>And I declare MakerFest OPEN !</p>

<p><strong>DAY 1</strong></p>

<p><em>(Asynchronously Documented)</em></p>

<p>I had my workshop on DAY 1 of the event, where i explained about 10 people, how to get started with MSP430 using the ever-cool <a href="http://energia.nu">Energia</a> . About 10 people attended the workshop. I distributed a getting started kit which had lots of components to test/begin any mcu platform.</p>

<p>And yah! If you too want to ask the same question? I dont work with TI; just spreading Awesomeness ! :D</p>

<p>My workshop took place is <strong>FabLab CEPT</strong>. It was a good time to explore what equipments they had. 
They had a epilog laser cutter, A 3D printer, An ultimaker that was probably being repaired, a FULL SCALE shopbot (Like the one you see in Ben’s videos ) Modella PCB mill, Roland Vinyl Cutter, a reciprocating saw and probably other stuff too.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/15665086594" title="Laser Cutter @ FABLAB CEPT by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8646/15665086594_2e7b704eac_z.jpg" width="640" height="359" alt="Laser Cutter @ FABLAB CEPT" /></a></p>

<p>When the workshop got over, i began visiting stalls and questioning (interviewing? eh) people about their product and idea. Whats better, i was joined by a friend <em>Sunil Sir</em> from <strong>Doo Things</strong>, Pune’s very own hackerspace. He is pretty amazing guy with knowledge of almost anything. Together we started visiting the stalls.</p>

<p>I got a chance to see what the <em>Google Cardboard</em> is all about. Basically there are two simulataneos images that a combined in your brain to give you an effect of VR.</p>

<p>A team from Surat, brought their college innovations of cheap solar cells using touchscreen panels and a scientifically validated water purifier for villages.</p>

<p>An inventor from Delhi (<em>Missing Delhi</em>) made a cool robot that can be controlled by an Android APP to draw things on the ground.Plus kids can program it in a custom language like <strong>Logo</strong> which introduces them the basics of programming. He is selling it in probably in a few weeks time. The wheels have encoders to help you get the drawing right and an IR sensor to do any avoidance activity. So, bye bye Turtle, Kids move the Robby !</p>

<p>Another <em>Delhiwalla</em> brought this amazing interactive cloth made using Bare Conductive ink and capactive sensing. It will play music of the part you touch. So, if you touch a leaf, it plays the sound of crumpled leaves. Cool !</p>

<p>Tired we were, So lets call it a day and explore the Food !</p>

<p>Another unusal ( in my frame of reference ) thing was this Wood Furnance Pizza stall on CEPT road. They make pizza by heating it in a mobile furnance. Curious to know whether it would taste different. We just ordered one. They usually bake thin crust (which i hate) and even after asking of a thick base, what turned out was thicker by a <em>Vernier’s Resolution</em> . The Pizza tasted good, But i would still put my money on the Indian Conventional way. (No Offences! Do Try it though.)</p>

<p>Asking for a good tea stall in Ellisbridge area, where our Hotel was, got us to <em>Mehta ‘s</em> which served the best tea in that area. Forget <em>cutting</em> ( tiny cup full of tea, enough to fill your mouth once), this was almost a hybrid of Tea and Lassi. Literally Loaded with Sugar and probably fits into the <em>Haryanavi</em> description of good tea - <em>Pani, Patti rok ke, Doodh, Chini Thok ke</em> !</p>

<p>Battery Low! and we now crashed thinking what next day had in store !</p>

<p><strong>Day 2</strong> :</p>

<p>Early Morning, we were joined by friends from <strong>Revealing Hour Creations</strong>. They had a workshop on their successfully crowd funded <em>Tah</em> board.</p>

<p>While Sunil, Dhiraj and Vikas continued to CEPT, I wanted to eat Jalebie and Fafda from the shop which (according to me) serves the best in the country-<em>Juna Sharebazaar near Nehru Nagar Circle</em> . So, i took an Auto and went to the place. It looked familier and this is what you get when you say- a bit of everything.</p>

<p><strong>Le Bhari !</strong></p>

<p>I walked my way to CEPT to explore the remaining stalls.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, i started to explore campus. There was this installation  where you have to move the handle and the pattern on the roof changes. The handle required quite a lot of effort but the effect was visible.

      <a href="/2014/12/14/Tinker-Rule/">
        TinkerRule- The Maker's Swiss Army Knife
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">14 Dec 2014</span>

    <p>This project was done during my time at <a href="http://www.cedtnsit.in/">TI-CEPD,NSIT,Delhi</a>. They have an awesome Winter Internship program going on, Be sure to have a look.</p>

<p>I source a lot of my components from Local Markets in Delhi like <em>Lajpat Rai Market</em> etc. The problem was that when buying stuff from such places we dont always get a part number, datasheet or footprint details with it, this is very bad when you want to use it in a board that you want to etch or fabricate.</p>

<p>There are two ways to overcome this issue (assuming that the package is not standard) :</p>

<ol>
  <li>Measure each and every thing using a vernier and then make a part for it in eagle.
    <blockquote>
      <p>I used to do it for a long time, until i made this. This is a bit more labourious approach and it involves too much measuring. But , i noticed that <strong>most</strong> leaded parts can be resolved in a 0.1inch grid.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>Make a reference and then use that to make parts without picking up the vernier.
    <blockquote>
      <p>In this we make a reference for most common footprints and use them as a reference. What’s better is that the known reference helps in finding out packages of some component you found lying in the parts bin.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>So, i kept on collecting ideas on what can be made into a tool that helps during the entire cycle from designing the part to etching the board comparing the parts and checking PCBs. Finally i had a list of things to do and started designing the Tool as a PCB on <em>Eagle</em> that can be etched. Nothing could offer me better precison than that.</p>

<p>After a few hours of designing, i etched the board (which took quite an effort), then selectively tinned a few pads and applied protective lacquer on the board.</p>

<p>Here’s what i mananged.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Continuity Tester</strong> : Built in basic continuity tester to check whether the tracks are correctly etched or whether there is any under cutting. Just plug those alligator clips on the exposed pads and see the LED light up incase of continuity.

  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Standard Packages</strong> : Some standard packages used, good to compare them and match.
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/16016173942" title="Tinker Rule Footprints by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8570/16016173942_aff8aefc2f_z.jpg" width="640" height="359" alt="Tinker Rule" /></a></p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>0.1 inch grid</strong> : This is the best one and used most of the times. Makes it easy to simulate breadboard/perfboard behaviour.

  <li>
    <p><strong>Common Drills</strong> : Most common drill sizes(bits) , just see what inserts easily and voila, we have a good enough drill size.

  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Track Widths</strong> : Compare track widths on the go.

  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Right angled rule with both inch and cm scale</strong> : Right angled makes it easy while cutting PCBs and marking them and cm and inch scales help in measuring.

  </li>
  <li><strong>Rust Buster</strong> : A fine sandpaper to rust off those parts that just dont solder .
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/15397629893" title="TinkerRule SandPaper by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8622/15397629893_70cf484542_z.jpg" width="640" height="359" alt="TinkerRule" /></a></li>
</ol>

<p>I have now been using it for quite sometime and its really useful and serves the purpose.</p>

<p>If you are interested in this i can mail you the file , just drop me an email at indiantinker [at] gmail [dot] com.</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>
