        Repurposing mass market addressable LEDs
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">04 Apr 2018</span>

    <blockquote>
  <p>This post describes an hack that allows one to re-purpose commonly available “fighter LED strips” to work with standard Neopixel firmwares. Also, this is my first post written in VIM \m/ . I have been having a good time using it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Recently, I was working on a design project that required me to produce illumination in different parts of a stair step and across different stairs. The obvious answer would be to use the WS2811/2812 LED strips. But, they can be very expensive and especially very difficult to procure in bulk quantities in India. The design was capped on the cost. The budget for LEDs was max 1000. I liked the idea, it satisfied the brief but only the cost variable was pushing it down.</p>

<p>It all changed on a recent trip to Pune. Pune has this power you see. I was half asleep in the bus when it stopped at the chikki corner in Lonanvala. Glancing outside with trivial expectations, I saw a “bhel corner” with Nyan cat type LEDs. I thought I was partially dreaming. I went outside and enquired. It was for real. The whole place was lit up with addressable LEDs. I looked around for signs of prosperity. None.</p>

<p>On enquiring, he says these strips cost him 850 rupees. They are available everywhere. Sceptically, I thought it might as well be available in Mumbai. The conversation ended with an extended Thank You and I was back to sleep, but planning my next trip to the worst electronics market i.e. Lamington . If its that cheap, there is tons of stuff that could be done, that was earlier rejected (like pixel walls)  due to budget constraints. These thoughts kept racing.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Next paragraph might seem to be a rant. Skip if you wish.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I visited Lamington post 5pm today. But yeah, I hate Lamington. Rational arguments? I am from Delhi (partially Pune). Delhi has Lajpat Rai Market. You can get tons of stuff there. Shopkeepers are there to make money. Do dhanda. Even if its Mehta, he will sell you stuff. But in Mumbai, they just shoo you away. I had to convince, Vega to give me a soldering iron bit that I saw in his poster. Thats the thing I am talking about. Let alone going inside, rummaging and getting things for you. I usually prefer ebay over lamington. LR–ebay–Abort(if unnecessary)–Lamington. The market in Delhi is very well packed together and addressable. Shops have numbers and everybody knows stuff. In Mumbai, Lamington is a hybrid Nehru Place, Wazirpur, and LR. The most useful part is just one row with switch point. Vega and Gala are Mehta’s of this place.The electronics market is also quite scattered. Another important point is the lack of cross referencing. In Delhi, usually, if someone does not have anything, he will guide you to another shop. Even if you ask a random shop to help you with the list, he would help you. Here its toooo competitive. X will not tell you the name of Y. He will straight away ignore this request like a bot. “ I don’t know” . There has been instances, where I got stuff just in the adjacent shop. So, its a dead end. Reload. This hampers the generation of a map of a market i usually use to plan my trips. For example, initially, It used to take me about 3-4 hours to get stuff in LR. Now, I hardly takes me an hour. Yes, I visit LR every time I am in Delhi.</p>

<p>So, I got the soldering bit and went on to search for the addressable LEDs. No one is ready to understand what I am saying. I even drew a picture of it. After spending about 2 hours. I laid my guns and started back for the station. I noticed near the station an audio equipment vendor has the exact same LEDs. I, kind of, beg him to tell me where he got them. I was pointed to go to Lohar Chawl, Kalbhadevi. He advised me to take a cab to a lane there they sell light fittings. A few stores there have these LEDs. These LEDs are difficult to find here in Lamington. Bingo, I took a cab and wondered about Kalbhadevi and Chawri Bazaar. Mumbai wins here. Kalbhadevi is like a paradise. It has anything you need. Mechanical shops, good vendors and helpful people. I reached Lohar Chawl, moved around a few shops, no luck here. One final shop, I thought. I drew again and explained him what I want. He said, <em>“Oh! You need a fighter LED strip?”</em> . I said, Ok? Let me see. He showed me and my eyes were wet and I bought it irrationally without bargaining the price. The thing costed me 650 for 5m. I later found a vendor who sold it to me for 450 too. Both were identical. So, <strong>fighter LED</strong> is the street name for addressable LEDs.</p>

<p>The default roll looked like this :</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h5TnJSPjE-A" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>It has a WS2811 chip that drives 3 RGB 5050 LEDs per segment. 
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/121xV90.jpg" alt="Imgur" /></p>

<p>The strip is powered by a 3A, 12V adapter. 
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/k41Rjgg.jpg?1" alt="Imgur" />
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/IkkiIpH.jpg" alt="Imgur" /></p>

<p>The controller is built on the strip. This is the coolest part.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/lJBTUWH.jpg" alt="Imgur" /></p>

<p>The name etching on the controller chip was sanded off, as expected. There was a 5V Zener to regulate power to the uC with a generous capacitor. 
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/33AqQ71.jpg?1" alt="Imgur" /></p>

<p>I removed 4 segments of 3 LEDs each from the end of the strip and soldered a DC jack to it.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/OybKC3G.jpg" alt="Imgur" /></p>

<p>I used the Tah board to give the strip a try. Did the usual stuff, Neopixellibrary and using 4 as LED number instead of 12 is the key here.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/hJ5Dsnp.jpg" alt="Imgur" />
You essentially have 4 segments. The defaults worked. The only issue is the Blue and Green commands are reversed. So, whenever the Blue command was initiated from the Arduino in Tah Avatar, the green leds were lit. 
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/eOczHqg.jpg" alt="Imgur" />
That is a minor issue. But the best part is I have an addressable LED strip that I can program for cheap and most importantly, available in bulk.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4fw5S28d51I?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>Do let me know if this was useful. I am building stuff using these LEDs now. Ok, Bye!</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>

<p>Rohit</p>

        FAND - shareable haptic foot interface device
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">03 Dec 2017</span>

    <blockquote>
  <p>The project research was presented at IEEE SeGAH 2018, Vienna in a paper published as <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8401321"> Gupta,R. &amp; Dalvi, G (2018, May). FAND: A shareable haptic foot interface device. </a> .</p>
</blockquote>

<p>FAND (Foot associated neural device) is a haptic interface device that allows users to operate a computer (or certain applications) using all four limbs. The device uses user trained motion gestures that are bound to actions on a compatible application. One may be surprised to know that foot is only 10% less accurate than the hand. The interaction model developed in the project divides a task in a primary action and a secondary action. The primary, high priority and accurate task is handled by the hand, while the secondary tasks are handled by the foot. Devices like these are useful in times when most of our interaction are performed by the hands. This has increased the physiological load on hands. The possible applications are in applications like creative apps, Walking in Place (WIP) interactions in VR, and gaming. I evaluated the device by comparing it with a novel hand interaction device. In the study it was found that the foot device offers comparable learning and may be considered as a possible modality.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Vxondpp.png" alt="Imgur" /></p>

<p>The video demonstrating the concept is shown below:</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ByvJjlRdu9M" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allow="encrypted-media" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<h4>User Persona</h4>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/W7SAryx.png" alt="Imgur" />
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/v5pzbJk.png" alt="Imgur" /></p>

<p>Several explorations and ideation were done in light of previous works and user studies conducted. The final report is be available <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CH4XgkzvzWaVjZDxJgtrWlma4ZTeb1hH/view?usp=sharing">here</a>. This report was made in Google Docs. ProTip: Do not use google docs of large documents. I never use google docs for more than 10 pages.</p>

<p>The post only covers some parts of a rather long design process (~ 6 months). I tried several techniques to understand the design of gesture systems. I did a <a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/wobbrock/">Wobbrock</a> style study to derive the guess-ability of certain guestures. The users were should de-contextualized prompts to certain interactions and were asked to come up with responses. I would encourage reading the paper by Wobbrock et al.</p>

<p>The prompts were like the below for zoom:
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/AfqMZQs.gif" alt="Imgur" /></p>

<p>Based on my <strong>user set</strong> the gesture set was as follows. One can obviously spot the similarities between these interactions and interactions performed by hands. Many users agreed that they performed the most natural interactions they could think of.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/P87F5J1.png" alt="Imgur" /></p>

<p>The gesture set was used with the following <em>design requirements</em> to come up with several concepts.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/1VtQrY4.png" alt="Imgur" /></p>

<p>The most dominant concept was of a shareable foot accessory that was prototyped. The process of prototyping was done separately for both form and function.</p>

<p>Form variations considering sharing and multiple foot types

<p>Functional Prototype made using Arduino running thresholding and a simple wave pattern recognizer algorithm on the data of a MPU6050 gyro sensor</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/TGOhCAQ.png" alt="Imgur" /></p>

<p>The prototype was tested with users using a true experiment design. The results showed that F(4,20) at p&lt;0.05 the device when compared to a new type of hand device like trackpoint has statistical significance (repeated measures ANOVA).Hence, both devices have similar learnability.</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>

        Notes on being a department placement co-ordinator at IDC, IIT Bombay
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">01 Dec 2017</span>

    <p>This post was made to avoid me “replaying” the episodic events of placements to whoever comes in to do groundwork for the post of a Placement Manager. It feels more like interrogation from unknown individuals.</p>

<p>The following is the “job description” for an IDC DPC. I hope that this would change in the future. Students, typically - IDCians and IDC DPCs would get more accountable to the work they signed up for. The point to remember is that everyone has work during those days and giving up on your position does not help in a highly connected system like the placements. It only increases the stress on other members.</p>

<p>The list is (mostly chronological) :</p>

<ol>
  <li>Getting students to pay for the placements.</li>
  <li>Ask them to join the “not-so-useful” google group</li>
  <li>Help them make resumes and get it verified, iteratively.</li>
  <li>Collect companies from various sources like:
    <ul>
      <li>Wishlists</li>
      <li>Past recruiters</li>
      <li>Organic converts</li>
      <li>Internship</li>
      <li>Engineering JAFS</li>
      <li>Alumnus</li>
      <li>CCL</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Collect preference list from students</li>
  <li>Get contacts</li>
  <li>Contact them reiteratively</li>
  <li>Get them to Register or register them</li>
  <li>Take JD from them and fill the JAF if HR is unable to do so.</li>
  <li>Ask them iteratively to send the details for verification</li>
  <li>Get the JAF verified from EO and EXO</li>
  <li>Slot the companies</li>
  <li>Negotiate slots with companies, PM and students</li>
  <li>Open JAF for students for min 2 days</li>
  <li>Put up a blog post for the same</li>
  <li>Push JAF information on Whatsapp and contact some individual students who are not there on these platforms via email and phone</li>
  <li>Solve student queries regarding JAFS and help them apply for the same</li>
  <li>Push students to apply as they wont and wait for the last moment</li>
  <li>Inform companies that the JAF has closed and assist them in downloading the resumes/portfolios</li>
  <li>Push them to release shortlists, if any</li>
  <li>Push shortlist on blog.</li>
  <li>Inform students via Email/Whatsapp/phone calls</li>
  <li>Get the tasks from companies, if any</li>
  <li>Push the same on the blog</li>
  <li>Assist students on logistics</li>
  <li>Keep reminding late submitters</li>
  <li>Collect tasks from all students and compile it</li>
  <li>Send it to HR and push for another shortlist</li>
  <li>Put the shortlist on blog</li>
  <li>Inform students again about shortlists vis Whatsapp/ email/ phonecalls</li>
  <li>Motivate and create hope</li>
  <li>Keep converting companies and adding JAFS</li>
  <li>Reopen JAFs if student to job probability falls or if companies want</li>
  <li>Ask confirmed HRs to fill IRF and arrange/negotiate for logistics</li>
  <li>co-ordinate with HRs about housing, food and travel</li>
  <li>Make PPTs happen</li>
  <li>Teach students how to fill preferences and get them filled</li>
  <li>Search for SPOCs on the day of placement. Kids you have never met.</li>
  <li>Get the floor plan made and SPOCs ready to turn up.</li>
  <li>Mail the details to HRs. The HRs whom we mail often are not the same as visting or they do not check emails. So, text is a better option.</li>
  <li>Solve queries regarding dress code and conduct</li>
  <li>Prepare for your own placement and get rejected</li>
  <li>Reach the venue as SPOCs wont reach on time.</li>
  <li>Get the internet working</li>
  <li>Serve water and tell them where tea is.</li>
  <li>Be a pseudo SPOC for multiple companies till SPOCs turn up</li>

<h2 id="suggestions-for-next-year">Suggestions for next year</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Unification of BDes and MDes placements</li>
  <li>A CC from IDC + 2-3 DPC. One IC from each should ideally carry on.</li>
  <li>Better communication with “legacy” companies</li>
  <li>Process should start early. Team join by April end and Work start by July 1st week</li>
  <li>Placement phase depends on BDes exchange timing.</li>
  <li>Best is to intimate companies before Nov about dates and have it ideally before 2nd week of Feb to avoid clashes with M.Des P3 Process</li>
  <li>Better division of work among all stakeholders- IDC DPCs, PMs, APCs and CCs</li>
  <li>A small training session for IDCians would be great. It should teach some niceties of interviewing and how not to be gullible.</li>
  <li>Japanese companies may be interested if, on-boarded early on</li>
  <li>An improved slotting should be possible to avoid job loss</li>
  <li>A placement team meet to introduce IDC DPCs/CC the process and people to contact as they usually end up bugging the PMs.</li>
  <li>Placement Session that educates students about the process and things to say and not to say.</li>
  <li>A category in type of companies as <em>Design</em> along with RnD/FMCG etc.</li>
  <li>SPOCs should report on time and send a greeting message whenever they are alloted the company.</li>
  <li>Automation of a lot of tasks like printing etc can be done from the portal.</li>
  <li>A separate section on the JAF filling portal for Design as usually companies complain that they cannot find the MDes or what to choose.</li>
  <li>Consider a paid placement for companies and free/reduced fee for students.</li>
  <li>Scrap the idea of two phase placements. They do not work as students loose interest, have too much work, DPCs academics get affected and may be scolded and rebuked by authorities.</li>
  <li>Smoothen the JAF verification process. It takes a lot of time to get JAFs verified.</li>
</ol>

<p>Best,</p>
