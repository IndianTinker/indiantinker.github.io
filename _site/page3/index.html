        Fiddle - The DIYed Music System
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">13 Nov 2014</span>

    <p><em>Zu ZU ZU ZU ZU UUUU ..BR.BR.CHIK</em> Thats how my old &#39;Phillips All in One&#39; failed a couple of weeks back. It was a pretty archaic piece. All it could do was play Cassettes, Do Radio, Had an Aux In and offcourse the marketed <strong>CD Player with a segmented Display</strong>. But today most of the music is digital and hence <em>Upgrade was necessary</em>.</p>

<p>I was planning to buy one and browsing the estores but then then <em>Makers Dilemma</em> struck me. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why Buy? When it can be Built!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And alas! I was fiddling with microcontrollers and SD Cards to make one. But couldnt get to the level i wanted. I wanted one that could:</p>

<ul>
<li>Play MP3s</li>
<li>Radio</li>
<li>Aux -IN</li>
<li>Take SD Cards</li>
<li>Remotes will be good too.</li>
</ul>

<p>Fitting such things in a project would rather be heavenly. I searched online for references and <em>You have it boy!</em> there is one ready to amplify (supply) module from our friends in China that does it all . See <a href="http://www.dx.com/p/1-0-led-car-mp3-player-module-w-fm-usb-mini-usb-sd-remote-controller-black-12v-126115#.VGbgJ4X7sjg">this</a>  .</p>

<p>I had seen this in a Taxi (less formally called <em>Gramin Seva</em>) while commuting to college once, which made me realise that this would certainly be available in India. The next day i was in the market looking for it and I did source it for about 9 $ (INR 500 )</p>

<p>Now all i need to do is :</p>

<ol>
<li>Decipher the connections</li>
<li>Build a power supply and Amplifier</li>
<li>Find/Repurpose/Build a 2-Component (1-Woof and 1-Tweeter) speaker box</li>
<li>Modify the box to fit all in </li>
<li>Enjoy</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Connections</strong> were pretty easy as the silkscreen had some references. It basically needs a <code>5V DC</code> supply that&#39;s the two pin connected on the left for and give <strong>stereo</strong> output using the 3 of 4 connectors on right (<em>Right, Left and GND</em>) and the last one is for the FM Antenna</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/15606424407" title="The Landscape by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5615/15606424407_8fb111d91a_z.jpg" width="640" height="359" alt="The Landscape"></a></p>

<p>The next part was testing if i will see the blue smoke of death as sometimes they can mess up with silkscreens too. <em>FingersCrossed</em></p>

<p>It worked fine and i was playing things off the USB straight away!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/15606417287" title="USB Reading by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7579/15606417287_413275e9f6_z.jpg" width="640" height="359" alt="USB Reading"></a></p>

<p>Now, the power supply and Amplifier. I used the omnipresent <code>7805 Regulator</code> that could power the module easily as i estimated the current requirements to be around <code>250-300mA</code> . The supply was going to be <code>12VDC</code> due to the Amp i was building and hence, a heat sink was necessary.
The Amp was build out of <strong>ST&#39;s</strong> <a href="http://www.st.com/st-web-ui/static/active/en/resource/technical/document/datasheet/CD00000128.pdf">TDA2030</a> which is a 14W,voltage friendly, High Fidelity (Correct Portrayl of sound without much loss in clarity), Class AB , Mono Amplifier.</p>

<p>The Application circuit works charm.
So, i assembled them on a single perfboard and was short of one heat sink. I now had to decide. Who needs the heat sink badly?</p>

<p>Demo runs showed <code>TDA2030</code> needs it badly. Now using some thermal glue and nuts and bolts i screwed the heatsink to the <code>TDA2030</code> and made a makeshift heat sink for <code>7805</code> </p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/15767878536" title="Circuit -Front by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5602/15767878536_fd9ff32190_z.jpg" width="640" height="359" alt="Circuit -Front"></a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/15606714790" title="Circuit- Back by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8562/15606714790_8d4cc5518c_z.jpg" width="640" height="359" alt="Circuit- Back"></a></p>

<p>I heard a strange buzz sometimes in the background which was because of some filtering issues. Adding a snubber (filter) for AC frequencies (50Hz) that was almost gone. Used the <code>10k</code> and <code>0.1uF</code> combination. </p>

<p>I had an Old but dis functional Column 2 component speaker, we had bought probably 12 years down the line. It was the ideal candidate for the purpose. Now opening and digging i found phenolic pcb with broken and corroded traces. I reworked them and the Woofer was working . (<em>Oh! Yeah</em>)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/15767875046" title="Look at that Woofer by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7520/15767875046_cb19326b8c_z.jpg" width="359" height="640" alt="Look at that Woofer"></a></p>

<p>I planned to fit the circuit inside the speaker box itself. For that i had to cut a small square pocket in the body for the module to peep out and the other electronics would be inside it.</p>

<p>This was a bit more difficult than anticipated. After 2 hours and 2 broken saw blades , I was able to do this.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/15789702321" title="The 2 hour , 2 broken blades cut by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7554/15789702321_4841f0be61_z.jpg" width="640" height="359" alt="The 2 hour , 2 broken blades cut"></a></p>

<p>Now it was assembling time.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/15789671841" title="All Messed up by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7468/15789671841_36e4735275_z.jpg" width="640" height="359" alt="All Messed up"></a></p>

<p>After a few half hours, i got it all working.. No Buzz and all music!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/15606708190" title="Charm by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5602/15606708190_e4c603c18e_z.jpg" width="359" height="640" alt="Charm"></a></p>

<p>Cheers!</p>
