    <span class="post-date">22 Mar 2017</span>

    <p>Back from yet another cycling trip are we?
This one was one of the recent best. Inspired by recent events of aimless discovery, we planned to go to <strong>Vipasana Pagoda</strong> and obviously detours. This time we were 3 people. Thadu, an energetic , super entu junior from BDes course and guess what, he has the guts to carry a full framers while cycling &gt;100k . So, as a story of our trips. We had a planned a route that we missed. I had bought <em>pebble</em> specifically for these activities. Only to discover that Google maps does not push notifications to pebble anymore !! <em>Duh</em> Anyone has options? I am all ears. Anyways <em>Endomondo</em> works great and we averaged 2:50 min/km on most roads.</p>

<p>So, the route was meant to be we take eastern, till Thane and then Fountain Chowk (yes! time does get dilated here), then beat some ghats and then go to Pagoda without going through the creeks and comeback from Versova after covering Gorai and Uttan beach. Much of it was inspired from <a href="http://bijoor.me/2013/03/31/cycling-along-the-mangroves-of-mumbai/">this</a> amazing cycling blog by Ashutosh.</p>

<p>But it did not end up like that.</p>

<p>We did took Eastern and cycled till Fountain Chowk. Here is a selfie at the chowk. This was probably the fastest sprint. Averaging around 2:15/km . But the roads were bad we you go down hill and without the front shocks you cant do some cylobatics.
But we made it, I had my <em>dogs-after-me</em> moment too. Somehow I attract Dogs randomly. At least this time I did not fall.</p>

<p>We somehow ended up in Borivali after that and had to take a <em>ferry</em> to cross the creek. CHECK</p>

<p>But as we moved towards the port, we could see the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Vipassana_Pagoda">Pagoda</a> in its magnificent brilliance inviting us.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/33507712956/in/dateposted-public/" title="IMG_20170319_094753"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/4/3767/33507712956_0274c33d3f_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_20170319_094753" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The next part of the journey was great. We visited Pagoda. Attended their 10 min Meditation session in the north pagoda.</p>

<p>The entry was magnificent and we felt as if we are at a film set or a slice of alternate reality embedded in our space .

<p>As Dinojh says the gems on the top were imported from Brazil. This is a greenish one captured from his monocular.

<p>The walls of the pagoda were all painted in golden color. Felt royal. The doors were made from wood imported from Burma. On the top of the Pagoda were some parts of the holy remains of Lord Buddha.</p>

<p>The inside of the pagoda. But only seasoned people are allowed inside.

<p>After the Pagoda, we had planned for Gorai, but thought we would cycle till Uttan beach and visit a great church there. Cycling till Uttan was an experience, the grade was a bit too much in the noon. But the Church was amazing, Worth it.</p>

<p>We also saw, a giant statue of Mother Mary with a classic Mediterranean feel and color palette. We could see the lighthouses around too.</p>

<p>Cycles at Uttan Beach. Almost got washed away as the sea transitioned from Low to High tide as we were exploring the beach</p>

<p>Crossing the Beaches Dinojh Style. So, this will be interesting. We had to see Gorai, because from what we could see it was far more happening than Uttan. Now, we could take the road, that was too much grade or cross from beach to beach. But <em>High Tide</em>. What a bystander suggested, “Your cycles are good, maybe you could carry it over the rocks?”</p>

<p>Me, “Carry? Cycles? They cant be classified in a logical set together”</p>

<p>Dinojh,” Come fast guys, I am already up here!”</p>

<p>Damn.. It was difficult to carry the cycle on the slippery rocks and stuff. Thanks to Dinojh, who helped me a lot. He actually carried it for most of the time. From now on Gorai beach was renamed, <strong>Dinojh Beach</strong>. #SuperManh</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/33164963280/in/dateposted-public/" title="2017-03-19 02.10.05 1"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/4/3790/33164963280_68aa97c79b_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="2017-03-19 02.10.05 1" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>From Gorai we cycled endlessly till we reached the port and then ferry &gt; Borivali &gt; Western</p>

<p><strong>Then</strong></p>

<p>Cycle punctured by apparently what looks like a fish-bone. BTwin tubes are super bad. They just cant be fixed. Needs replacement of the tube. This is the second time this is happening to me. Bad BTWin.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/32734078153/in/dateposted-public/" title="IMG_20170319_173536"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/4/3753/32734078153_e91e486a6c_z.jpg" width="480" height="640" alt="IMG_20170319_173536" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>We did not continue on Western as it was too hot and we took, the Aarey colony road till Powai and then reached IIT.</p>

<p>Phew. I just crashed after reaching, only to wake up 2 hours later with tons of assignments in my bad waiting to be started and a lingering taste of the adventure of the day resonating in the background.</p>

<p>Until next time.</p>

<p>さよなら</p>

<p>再见</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>

        Me Dinojh and 100kms on cycle
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">12 Mar 2017</span>

    <p>Crazy things happen , <em>sometimes</em>. This was one of those crazy things. Cycling has recently been my favorite sport and medium of geographical exploration. Over-complicating isn’t it. I love to cycle around the campus. In the morning you have this cool breeze that wakes your lethargic body up from within when you cycle around.</p>

<p>My good friend (Dinojh) who is also an amazing maker, a Product Designer and a cyclist helps me and essentially ignites the wacky cycling plans, I make. He has never said <strong>No</strong>. But this time after our last trip that was planned for Matunga ended up in an almost Dadar Darshan, I was cautious.</p>

<p>I wanted to cycle in South Bombay, especially the Marine Drive. So, the plan was to lug the cycle in the Local and reach CST and then cycle around, have breakfast and come back via Train preferably or if possible we can cycle back.</p>

<p>By (Safety Officer) Dinojh has other plans always. He is the one who hates public transport and would cycle anywhere. The only line of reason being , “Why not?”.</p>

<p>We ended ditching the Train out of the plan altogether. It ended up a 101.2km ride to and fro from IIT Bombay. Back breaking, mind numbing but we did quite a lot of exploration, actually most of South Bombay was peddled.</p>

<p>Phew. Lets start from the beginning.</p>

<p>We started from IIT around 6:45am in the morning. It was cold. The supplies to the canteen were coming in. We knew we wont be having any breakfast till CST so, ate up energy bars to help us fueled up. We carry 5litres of water as Dinojh always insists that he runs on water.</p>

<p>We took the eastern expressway all the way till CST. Stopping multiple times and having been lured into a few <em>detours</em> thanks to those escher-ed flyovers Bombay has.</p>

<p>We reached CST. It felt great. Actually we were peddling under a highway and it was CST all of a sudden.</p>

<p>We had breakfast at the Legendary Kyani Bakery. I really love the idea of hanging stair supports that they have.I had already tasted the place the last week in a cheese craving trance. Decent is my verdict. Lets not wake up the foodie inside. Ummmm.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/32624876730/in/dateposted-public/" title="2017-02-19 03.07.15 1"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2357/32624876730_02d91911be_z.jpg" width="640" height="640" alt="2017-02-19 03.07.15 1" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Look what we found in the parking lot</p>

<p>Next up was Nariman Point which would set the starting point of our Marine Drive Adventure Lap.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/32337276544/in/dateposted-public/" title="2017-02-26 09.38.22 1"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2820/32337276544_79d01e0fd6_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="2017-02-26 09.38.22 1" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Now we cycled from Nariman point till we lost our breath, guess where? Bandganga, near Malabar Hills.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/33135629431/in/dateposted-public/" title="IMG_20170226_100757"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/698/33135629431_583eeae020_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_20170226_100757" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The place looked nice for cycling. So, we cycled criss cross in the area. I could not manage some of the climbs though. Lured by the decent, we came down to Marine Drive. Boooo.. We missed Hanging Gardens it seems. No point of coming this far and not visiting Hanging Gardens, said Dinojh.</p>

<p>Okay Then!</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/33135626571/in/dateposted-public/" title="IMG_20170226_104614"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/570/33135626571_352307ba9e_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_20170226_104614" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>We also planned to learn more about the <em>Tower of Silence</em>. But it turned out to be a private property. No Entry la !</p>

<p>But here is the cliched point to click the queen’s necklace. Yeah Yeah! The shoe house was still there.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/33025980422/in/dateposted-public/" title="2017-02-26 11.04.15 1"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/699/33025980422_74d07db0db_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="2017-02-26 11.04.15 1" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Hungry again, we went back to Kyani and had some food. The place has for me temporarily crossed its marginal utility.</p>

<p>Next, we visited JJ School of Art to check out the amazing Fine Art exhibition. Thanks Avinash for the tip. Some pictures.</p>

<p>Photography was restricted inside and we are law abiding citizens. So, yeah ! This is what we could capture.</p>

<p>Next what?
Well lots of it. Lets go to Fashion street. Why? Because its there and Dinojh has not seen it. Same for Gateway, NGMA, Price of Wales Museum and then back to CST.</p>

<p>We got ourselves clicked an instant photo at Gateway. The photographer was a part time working student and taught us some cool street photography tricks especially in sun.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/32580676763/in/dateposted-public/" title="2017-03-12_05-45-12"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/4/3734/32580676763_bf4f84d663_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="2017-03-12_05-45-12" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>From CST we started our deadman’s crawl back home. I barely managed to be back. One should <strong>always</strong> buy those cycling shorts and not just go. Be like Dinojh.</p>

<p>I remember this particular instance when I almost gave up around Dadar and was pissed off at the traffic condition there. You had these Taxi’s on the road side, they dont have a hazard switch or its very difficult to operate. Then as you would be passing by, like a dormant land mine he would come in your path and you apply those discy drum brakes.</p>

<p>Now imagine to do this multiple times in the next 1km. Takes the fun out. I dislodged from the cycle and walked a while. Dinoj like a horse would just go until he would realize that he is not riding alone. I walked and asked Dinojh, “ Dudeh (h is mandatory to make it sound like mallu), I wont be able to make it, my back hurts and blah..blah..” He said , “just smile (plus some random convincing stat about muscles)  and  change the posture to this”.</p>

<p>That actually helped, i mean the posture part. As we made it to the Eastern Highway, we had a smooth journey post that. We we entered campus back, it was as if some refugees came back to their motherland. We cycled faster and reached hostel. Puffff.</p>

<p>Mission Accomplished.</p>

<p>Thank Youh Dinojh :)</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>

<p>Rohit</p>

        Making processing and fluidsynth talk
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">12 Feb 2017</span>

    <p>Just a quick post if you are interested in triggering notes from Processing to Fluidsynth. It could be great if your works have a visual component and you need responsive notes in the background that you wish to play using your soundfont via Fluidsynth.</p>

<p>Fluidsynth listens to commands via a telnet socket on port 8888 (you can change this i guess) that you can write to using a processing sketch.</p>

<p>So, just write to the socket if something turns up. It makes it very useful while making realistic music installation when playing frequency correct notes. There is also an option to use minim library, but i found it pretty complex and wanted a modular approach where i can fiddle with the audio program. I also feel it is a bit more responsive.</p>

<p>The code looks like :</p>
