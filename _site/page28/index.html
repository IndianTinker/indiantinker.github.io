        The Noob's Guide to Pune Relocation
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">12 Apr 2015</span>

    <p>It has almost been 8 months since i moved to Pune for Work from my hometown <em>Delhi</em> . Pune has a comparably benevolent weather as compared to Delhi. Summers are sweeter and so are winters. People of the city are great. They are quite helpful and humble. The city’s older areas have stark resemblance to Old Delhi and has lots of nice Forts, Temples, Museums and best of all eateries. Language is not a major issue as Marathi is somewhat similar to Hindi and most people understand Hindi but prefer to talk in Marathi. <em>Changla !</em></p>

<p>I am writing is post mostly in a log format and will keep adding information as an when I get more.</p>

<p>If google sent you here, then probably you too are interested/moving to Pune soon.I hope you find the information useful. The post is divided into several important sections that will be updated from time to time. Lots of unorganized info to follow so lets get started:</p>

<p><strong>Shelter</strong></p>

<p><em>This section deals with housing related things</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>If you are coming here for an IT company, most of them are concentrated in <em>Hinjewadi and Wakad</em> side of Pune, which geographically comes under Pimpri Chinchwad city of Pune Metropolitan Region. Then most popular housing locations will be Wakad, Hinjewadi, Vishal Nagar(Jagtap Dairy), Pimple Saudagar and Pimple Gurav.</li>
  <li>Before you hit the land, searching for houses/flats , take note of the relocation policy of your company and make sure brokerage is covered.</li>
  <li>Choose room-mates wisely. Initial judgements can be pretentious. You would certainly like to live with people on the same frequency as your’ s else, things could go wary.</li>
  <li>Prefer searching online on sites like <a href="http://housing.com/">Housing.com</a>, <a href="http://www.magicbricks.com">MagicBricks</a> etc first and prefer ones that are listed by Owners themselves to avoid steep brokerage , which is usually 1 month rent for 11 months agreement and 2 months rent for more than 11 months.</li>
  <li>Most societies have a board <em>Beware of Dogs</em> right below a board that says <strong>Bachelors Not Allowed</strong> that pretty much sets their priorities straight. Dont go looking for flats in them.</li>
  <li>Prefer on <em>pakka</em> agreement which requires you to go to the municipality office against a Notary Agreement. This depends on the landlord entirely. A pakka agreement is useful when you wish to own a vehicle in Pune where a notorized one bites the dust.</li>
  <li>In case you need furniture, the market has a rental based system. You can buy cheap and flimsy furniture and once you leave you can return it for 50-60% its value. Mattresses are also available for cheap.</li>
  <li>Some flats come with a furnished status but are usually 10k more than normal. If you plan to stay about 11 months then evaluate the economics. 10k* 11 = 1,11,000 INR. So, if the facilities are worth that even after depreciation. Go for it! else negotiate.</li>
  <li>Chalk out a <em>Room Mate Agreement</em> like Sheldon ! It helps in long run.</li>
  <li>D Mart is the best place to shop here.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Transportation</strong></p>

<p><em>This section deals with Transportation related things</em></p>

<h2 id="expect-nothing">Expect Nothing</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The city’s transport is abysmal and has been so since ages. The Pune City is a bit better but PCMC is worse. Its like Noida of Pune. Auto walla’s make money on your sufferings.Prefer Ola Cabs !</li>
  <li>You wont get a direct bus quite often. That was pretty irritating initially until i met Mr. Chaturvedi on the Rakshak Chowk Bus Stop one day. He his golden words were:  “Only a few buses go to your destination directly, but many go that way !” Saying so he boarded his bus to Vishrantwadi leaving me with ideas ! So, the trick is use <strong>Here Transit</strong> to find buses that go in the direction you want and board them and deboard at the point they divert from your path and then reboard. So, if you want to go to FC Road. Take a bus for PMC/Station and use the above algo.</li>
  <li>Get a 2 wheeler (I don’t have one though) ! OLX is great place to find or go to Rasta Peth for second hand stuff. Again you have to pay more to the brokers here, and a notorized agreement wont work !</li>
  <li>There is also a local train service in Pune but is not preferred unless you wish to travel out of the city like going to <em>Lonavala</em> or <em>Malavali</em> etc.</li>
  <li>If you wish to go to Mumbai ! Trust only <strong>Shivneri</strong> , Neeta has a terrible service everywhere and even to Ahemadabad (Been there Done that). You can also take shared cabs from Chinchwad Station. They charge about 200 - 250 bucks based on demand.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Food</strong></p>

<p><em>This section deals with Food related things</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>Everything is awesome! There are lot of options here. Dosa’s and Vada Pao’s are like staple street foods. The Standard Price for Vada Pao is 10 bucks and Dosa is 20- 30 bucks .</li>
  <li>There are lot of good places in the city. Try GoodLuck Cafe’s Fruit Fanny,La Plaisir Patisserie &amp; Bistro’s Chesse Cake, Garden Vada Pao , Marz-o-rin’s Sandwiches, Durvankur’s Thali or Sabutdana Wadi at Shaniwar Wada. Check Zomato for more listings. There is a <em>Burger King</em> as well in Koregaon Park where you get <em>gross</em> burgers and the infamous <em>German Bakery</em> is there too, near Osho Ashram</li>
  <li>You can’t get on eating from these restaurants on daily basis so, for usual days you can either hire a cook. There is no dearth of them and they charge around 600-700 per head.</li>
  <li>If cook is too much of a pain, go get a dabbawalla . He serves hot food in a tiffin at a reasonable price. Do ping me in the comments if you need any contacts. I have tried about 4 of them :P</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Internet</strong></p>

<p><em>This section deals with Connectivity related things</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>Internet Broadband service is a booming business here and there are tons and tons of them. To name a few Spectranet, iConnect, Reliance, Tikona, Tata Docomo, Airtel etc.</li>
  <li>Tikona is Ok and there are several breakdowns, but customer service is good.</li>
  <li>Docomo is great but limited to certain societies only.</li>
  <li>Reliance s*#ks as usual ! No support and useless Helplines, but its the cheapest.</li>
  <li>iConnect and Sprectranet are good too but again limited to some societies.</li>
  <li>As far as cellular connectivity is concerned. Voda&gt;Idea&gt;Airtel&gt;Docomo</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>POIs</strong></p>

<p><em>This section deals with Places to roam around</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>Shaniwar Wada</li>
  <li>Dagdu Shet Ganpati Temple</li>
  <li>Raja Dinakar Museum</li>
  <li>Lonavala</li>
  <li>Karla Caves , Malavali</li>
  <li>Sinhagad Fort</li>
  <li>Bike ride through Pashan Area</li>
  <li><em>will add more as i visit</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Hope people find this useful!</p>

<p>Cheers !!</p>

<p>Rohit</p>

        Kindify- Making PDFs readable on the Kindle
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">05 Apr 2015</span>

    <p>Probably <strong>YOU</strong> too bought the kindle to read those pdfs that you having been stashing in your hard drive and wondering when you will get to read them. <strong>YOU</strong> too considered it would be fantastic to read them, a single device for only books. Consider this no calumny to the device. But PDFs are seriously not its cup of tea. Mercurial, <strong>YOU</strong> might be seeing the way the PDF is rendered on the crisp screen. All those toggling and finger gymnastics to get to the line. Dah! I too didn’t seem comfortable.</p>

<p>Next came the fever of converting them to funny formats like .mobi etc that made a nicely indented book look like a unorganised vomit of words.</p>

<p>I tried assiduously to somehow read and lost interest until I stumbled upon a slick python library <em>pyPDF</em> while solving a problem with printing PDFs.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Clip the borders and Light you shall see !</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Kindle does automatically clip borders but it retains the primordial page number which limits the usability and since, it also indexes the page number anyway, even if I remove it using some python script it wont hurt.</p>

<p>So, This is what kindify does. Its a command line python utility that simply takes the pdf you intent to read and returns a PDF with the same name but -kindified appended to its file name to be read on the Kindle.</p>

<p>The only dependency is <em>pyPDF</em> .</p>

<p>Install PyPDF using pip :
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pip install pypdf</code></p>

<p>Now clone the github repository:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git clone https://github.com/IndianTinker/kindify.git</code></p>

<p>Now, paste the PDF in the kindify directory and run the command:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">python kindify.py yourPdfName.pdf</code></p>

<p>An interactive menu will pop up with list of some famous book houses that have predefined cropping parameters. You can always choose the custom one to suit your needs or edit the predefined ones to suit your needs.</p>

<p>Lets see the magic in this sample from Orielly.
Before the script the PDF renders as follows:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/16834820407" title="Pre Script by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8752/16834820407_9c9be5a74e_z.jpg" width="385" height="640" alt="Pre Script" /></a></p>

<p>And after the script</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/16854436058" title="Post Script by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7620/16854436058_2968e35402_z.jpg" width="423" height="640" alt="Post Script" /></a></p>

<p>There is a difference between the two images. Clearly the second one is a <em>bit</em> more clear.
So, yet again Python saves the day!</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>

<p>Rohit</p>

        Improving UX of FM/AM Audio
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">02 Apr 2015</span>

    <blockquote>
  <p>This post describes the work done during my time at Tata Motors Research Center in Pune. I worked as an Assistant Manager in Human Machine Interface department. Here, I present my work on defining strategies to improve FM/AM user experience and implementation of the same. The work was first used in Tata Tiago/Tigor.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Good Design is as Little Design as Possible” — D. Rams</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Context</h4>
<p>With a burst of highly “connected” media options available in cars, FM/AM or Radio still happens to be a widely used feature in infotainment units.  However, based on many field requests the experience of FM was not at par with other media options like USB/BT/SD and needed some rethinking. Further, there was a need to establish a more data-informed tuning process.</p>

<h4>Work</h4>
<p>The work started by understanding the entire signal reception flow from the antenna to the infotainment unit and the chip in infotainment. We explored to the level of the algorithms used in the RTOS to play channels. This helped us, as designers/engineers get a perspective on the scope of changes. We even studied the antenna cables and their routing. This helped us identify their vicinity with EM noise generating components like alternators and engine. Then we did a small exercise to find out possible conditions that might result in pain points. These were a sudden loss of reception (when entering an area with no coverage like a tunnel), reducing signal strength (when traveling outside the city), and system scanning for stations (auto store). We carried out several benchmarking sprints with our spectrum analyzer which gave us the ground truth. A comparison with other competitive cars was done. It was quite a hectic process. We had to often drive in places where there was not even a road and test reception. A customer can be anywhere, we should provide the best experience everywhere was the motivation.  A nice part was we could see some country and eat some local food. But we spent the whole day in hot weather in test cars.  After about 5-6 such exercises over a few months, we were able to suggest an FM algorithm that could be implemented. In the process, we figured out how to do spectrum analysis and find signal strength values. Then correlate it with readings of the infotainment, figure out leaks, and calibrate the system. <br /> The simulation exercises helped and we were able to detect conditions like tunnel entry, driving out of zone based on readings. We would dynamically adjust the volume curve/filters based on such events.</p>

<h4>Learnings</h4>
<p>The work was challenging and I read a lot on FM/AM. I learned to operate the spectrum analyzers as well. This sparked my interest in Audio based user experiences in a car environment. The whole exercise also taught me about the design of such a system. I was in a weird position in Tata Motors, I was doing the work of design to technology integration. I would know what users want and could understand what the engineering team was doing in the code. I had to work on aligning all these stakeholders together. BTW, I even made <a href="/2015/05/17/FM430/">my own FM receiver</a> that could show vague signal strength, when I was finding it hard to understand that spectrum analyzer. :)</p>

<h4>How it affected the company</h4>
<p>The same FM/AM reception component was used in several other platforms. It seems to have improved the shape FM/AM was in the car. The experience was pushed as a part of Tiago/Tigor and may even have been pushed to others.</p>

<p><strong>Skills</strong>: Research Methodology, Design Integration, UX, and Spectrum analysis</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>
