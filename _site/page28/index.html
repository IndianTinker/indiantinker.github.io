        FM430 - FM using MSP430
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">17 May 2015</span>

    <p>One fine day while i was rummaging through the part bin, I found an old project that probably was never completed ! <strong>FM Radio</strong> !
I tried to make one when i was in 7th grade, waiting at the counter of a dingy electronics repair shop for anyone to pay attention to the parts list gathered over the internet ( Dial up days ! ).</p>

<p>At that time, i just jotted down all i could from the internet and went straight to the repair guy expecting some help. It never did work and i soon lost interest but it remained until recently when i was skimming ebay to get some stuff and i saw ‘TEA5767 FM Receiver’ module selling for 0.99 $ . Cheap is attractive specially in DIY world and the rest was involuntary . After 20 days the module was with me.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.voti.nl/docs/TEA5767.pdf">TEA5767</a> is a digital FM Receiver chip from NXP/Phillips that can be commanded over I2C to tune to various frequencies easily.</p>

<p>But alas ! The one i got never matched with any pictures online ! Where was the missing “crystal” responsible for all the PLL stuff? Where are all the other pins ? That was frustrating. Thanks to the cryptic words written on the silkscreen “TT-502X” i was able to find out that only one person except me happen to have posted about this and he apparently has documented it in a schematic! Thanks to <a href="http://elect.wikispaces.com/Digital+audio+amplifier+with+PLL+synthesized+FM+radio">Dilshan</a>, an amazing maker himself, I was able to get this done.</p>

<p>It turns out that the module is actually used in some Samsung Products and requires a <em>generic</em> watch crystal.</p>

<p>The connections are similar to what <em>Dilshan</em> mentions it in his post. I added a diode (Reverse Polarity. Ouch!) and a decoupling cap. And after a bit of work with the solder iron i was able to make my own FM Receiver Module.</p>

<p>Next step? Let others know about it… :D</p>

<p>FYI that pigtail type antenna was useless ! I needed a 81cm long wire for (Wavelength/4) law to work for 87.5 Mhz.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/17152069784" title="Back side ! by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8820/17152069784_99f4e30138_z.jpg" width="359" height="640" alt="Back side !" /></a></p>

<p>After doing the same! A commander was needed. Chose my workhorse, the MSP430 Launchpad for the extra switch they have on it that helps me change channels and doing that on arduino pro mini would require some breadboarding i was too lazy to try.</p>

<p>The code is pretty easy and shown below. It was coded using <a href="http://energia.nu/">Energia</a> IDE.</p>

<p>Based on the datasheet the I2C address of the device is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0x60</code> and we begin wire transmission using the wire library. Then we send the upper byte and lower byte of the frequency we wish to tune to based on the formula mentioned in to code and also on datasheet page 30 that depends on what clock you are using and whether you are using High side or low side injection. Since, we are using high side injection (Reason : Not known. Please share if you happen to know.) for superhetrodyne Receiver we used the formula mentioned in the code.</p>

<p>The other data bytes i.e. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0xB0</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0x10</code> are for setting the chip for enabling stereo ,disabling mute, use the watch crystal , pull some programmable pins low, enable High side injection etc. Check the page 14 Of Datasheet for more info.</p>

<p>I made an array that has the channels available here in Pune and on the press of a button the global variable frequency is updated with the latest value and the function is called to set it inside the TEA5767 and Bam! It works !</p>

    <p>Buzz..Buzzzz..buzzzzzzzz .. That is how a lone mosquito irritates you in the middle of the night trying to convince you that his lullaby is helpful. Insignificant or not, But truly that is the underlying inspiration for this project. The Mosquito repellents have this obnoxious smell that I would not like to sleep in and these loner mosquitoes who just piss me off by buzzing in the ear, you have to choose a lesser evil. Obviously, I turned ON the repellent and in a while it goes off but the smell starts building up and I am too lazy to turn it back OFF, leaving the warmed blanket on a chilly Delhi December Night. The nocturnal dilemma .</p>

<p>So, why not just use a remote to turn it back off and maybe add some other things like Reading Light control, Mood Lighting?</p>

<p>Interesting !!</p>

<p>Having the above in mind I thought of building my own <em>Room Automation and Mood Lighting controller</em> and for this time make it look good and “no mess visible”. I had bought some nice overpriced project enclosures a while back and the bigger one of them would be perfect for the project.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/16710796873" title="The Box by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7788/16710796873_8320541058_z.jpg" width="640" height="359" alt="The Box" /></a></p>

<p>So, the plan was   :</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Use the old Sony Remote and with it try simply turn ON/OFF some relays for the light sockets and also dabble with a RGB LED strip to give the room a different tint at night. The system should be able to tell if a wrong action has been taken by itself. Above all it should look good (on the wall).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For the recipe, the main ingredient is <strong>MSP430</strong> as I was able to get it in a desired TSSOP package from TI itself (The local sellers don’t seem to like SMDs), Its easy to play with thanks to <em>Energia</em> and best of all - <em>Low Power</em> .</p>

<p>I chose to use <a href="http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/msp430g2553.pdf">MSP430G2553</a> as i already had the chip in DIP to prototype with.</p>

<p>For driving the relays and the RGB LED strip ( a small part of the bigger strip with actually just 12 LEDs ) , I used <a href="http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/uln2803a.pdf">ULN2803</a> , the octa darlington chip. And Yes ! I didnt use opto isolation for the relays.</p>

<p>For demodulating the 38kHz IR Pulse train, I used a locally available TSOP1738 IR Receiver and for regulating power to the MSP430 I used <a href="http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/lp2951-n.pdf">LP2950-3.3V</a>, a TO92 packaged 100mA LDO .</p>

<p>Next, i needed some LEDs to tell which load is ON/OFF and a DC jack to mate the final module with my wall wart.</p>

<p>That’s pretty much the circuit part. Once, i had all the components on my table. I designed a small PCB to fit the box and house all the components and a separate Relay board for the Sockets ! Next after <strong>Toner Transfer</strong> and some etching in my <a href="http://rohitg.in/2014/04/07/OpenAgitator/">OpenAgitator</a> I got this sparkling PCB .</p>

<p>Some soldering !</p>

<p>and some Brain Implant ( aka Code Download )</p>

<p>Next, made amends for the switch board to be compatible with the project. Basically, just added wires in parallel to the switches. Did somebody say <strong>Manual Over-ride</strong> ?</p>

<p>The wiring mess inside the switch-board.

<p>All cleared up !

<p>After that, i simply wired the wires (!) to the relay board ( See the Video below ) and powered it up.</p>

<p>Now with a press of the button, Its all done ! I already feel so lazy!</p>

<p>And yes here are the colors !</p>

    <p>Toner Transfer Method.. is no doubt sheer Awesomeness. With just a few steps you can have your prototype in your hands without waiting for weeks for the fab house to deliver. Certainly relieves me of a lot of anxiety. I even made this <a href="http://rohitg.in/2014/04/07/OpenAgitator/">Open Agitator</a> a while back to help me ease out the etching process.</p>

<p>I usually (used to) print my designs on the glossy photopaper near my college where there is a usual hub of shops catering to student needs. Carrying the photopapers from my house to the college in the crowded metro would often crumble them. I preferred buying them from the local stationary shops near the college itself who would sell it at varying prices anachronistically.</p>

<p>The shop used to charge for a round of paper into the printer (actually one print) and if i printed multiple on the same sheet, if was charged more. As students we <em>should</em> cut costs. Further the <em>several-times-on-a-page</em> approach had more issues:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Printing on a sheet many times causes it to blacken due to the unhealthy state of drum on public printers</li>
  <li>The shop keeper usually charges for a single round in the printer and printing many times added to the costs.</li>
  <li>I had to always mark the point for the orientation of the print, else if the print goes the other way again, i can have the next file printed on the previous file , rendering the entire excercise useless. Actually that has happened twice :)</li>
  <li>You also need to set the no scaling option in <em>Acrobat</em> again and again.. duh..</li>
</ul>

<p>Thats too much work specially after waiting in a queue to get to the printer !</p>

<p>I actually never thought of getting out of this circle for a while until the last few semesters, which were less academically demanding. I then wrote a small python script to combine all the pages that i used to print seperately to a <strong>Single</strong> page and then go and just print one pdf. No worries about messing up the orientation/scaling etc..</p>

<p>Well.. Why python when i could have used any photo-editing tool? Its simpler and automatic and I had once messed around the scale on a photo-editing tool and had to <em>re-etch (just imagine)</em> a whole board.</p>

<p><strong>The Process</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Like usual ways instead of directly printing files to printer, print them to pdf and choose different locations like center, top, left etc or you may also manually do that using the margins.Make sure that they dont overlap.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This way you will have many pdfs on the same folder. Now:
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git clone https://github.com/IndianTinker/BoardMerge.git</code>  or download from <a href="https://github.com/IndianTinker/BoardMerge">here</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You need to install pyPDF dependency. PIP is the boss here!
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sudo pip install pypdf</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now paste the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">merge.py</code> in the active eagle folder and run :
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">python merge.py file1.pdf file2.pdf .. .. ..</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Wait till it gets completed and you shall see a file <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Combine.pdf</code> with all the pdfs on a single page!</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>This a directory full of 17 pdfs !</p>

<p>After some python-fu you get this:</p>

<p>Hoping that fellow makers find it useful.</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>
