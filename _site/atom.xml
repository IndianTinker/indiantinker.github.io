   <title>Nokia 5110 LCDs and MSP430</title>
   <link href="http://rohitg.in/2014/11/09/Nokia5510-lcd-with-MSP430/"/>
   <updated>2014-11-09T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
   <id>http://rohitg.in/2014/11/09/Nokia5510-lcd-with-MSP430</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I had this Nokia LCD i picked up a while back. It is perfect when you want to play with graphics on a tiny lcd that comes from the good old days of Nokia&amp;#39;s Monochome days. Several might have spent days playing space invaders/snakes etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The time came when I was bored in my hotel room and I had it in my parts bin which i was carrying while moving from Delhi to Pune.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The LCD used a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/LCD/Monochrome/Nokia5110.pdf&quot;&gt;Phillips PCD 8544 Driver&lt;/a&gt; which communicates on SPI.The voltage levels are &lt;code&gt;2.7-3.3V&lt;/code&gt; happy for our MSP430.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;NYC&lt;/em&gt; has a pretty nice explanation on how it works and how to play with it with MSP430 over on his &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.msp430launchpad.com/2012/08/using-nokia-lcd-library.html&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For TL:DR; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The LCD has the following pins to interface to:
&lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;
.tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;}
.tg td{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;padding:10px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;}
.tg th{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-weight:normal;padding:10px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;}
&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;table class=&quot;tg&quot;&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th class=&quot;tg-031e&quot;&gt;Pin Number&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th class=&quot;tg-031e&quot;&gt;Pin Label&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th class=&quot;tg-031e&quot;&gt;Pin Function&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th class=&quot;tg-031e&quot;&gt;Input/Output?&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;th class=&quot;tg-031e&quot;&gt;Notes&lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td class=&quot;tg-031e&quot;&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td class=&quot;tg-031e&quot;&gt;VCC&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td class=&quot;tg-031e&quot;&gt;Positive power supply&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td class=&quot;tg-031e&quot;&gt;Input&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td class=&quot;tg-031e&quot;&gt;Supply range is between 2.7V and 3.3V&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td class=&quot;tg-031e&quot;&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td class=&quot;tg-031e&quot;&gt;GND&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td class=&quot;tg-031e&quot;&gt;Ground&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td class=&quot;tg-031e&quot;&gt;Input&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td class=&quot;tg-031e&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td class=&quot;tg-031e&quot;&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td class=&quot;tg-031e&quot;&gt;SCE&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td class=&quot;tg-031e&quot;&gt;Chip select&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td class=&quot;tg-031e&quot;&gt;Input&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td class=&quot;tg-031e&quot;&gt;Active low&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td class=&quot;tg-031e&quot;&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td class=&quot;tg-031e&quot;&gt;RST&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td class=&quot;tg-031e&quot;&gt;Reset&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td class=&quot;tg-031e&quot;&gt;Input&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td class=&quot;tg-031e&quot;&gt;Active low&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td class=&quot;tg-031e&quot;&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td class=&quot;tg-031e&quot;&gt;D/C&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td class=&quot;tg-031e&quot;&gt;Mode select&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td class=&quot;tg-031e&quot;&gt;Input&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td class=&quot;tg-031e&quot;&gt;Select between command mode (low) and data mode (high).&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td class=&quot;tg-031e&quot;&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td class=&quot;tg-031e&quot;&gt;DN(MOSI)&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td class=&quot;tg-031e&quot;&gt;Serial data in&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td class=&quot;tg-031e&quot;&gt;Input&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td class=&quot;tg-031e&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td class=&quot;tg-031e&quot;&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td class=&quot;tg-031e&quot;&gt;SCLK&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td class=&quot;tg-031e&quot;&gt;Serial clock&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td class=&quot;tg-031e&quot;&gt;Input&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td class=&quot;tg-031e&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td class=&quot;tg-031e&quot;&gt;8&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td class=&quot;tg-031e&quot;&gt;LED&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td class=&quot;tg-031e&quot;&gt;LED backlight supply&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td class=&quot;tg-031e&quot;&gt;Input&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td class=&quot;tg-031e&quot;&gt;Maximum voltage supply is 3.3V.&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The display is divided into 6 horizontal bands of 8 bits each (48) and 84 columns .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a time you write to a single bank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you can continue to update only a single bank just in case you have dynamic data in that particular bank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The communication is done using SPI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code that i used is based on &lt;a href=&quot;http://forum.43oh.com/topic/1312-nokia-5110-display/&quot;&gt;RobG&amp;#39;s post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It displays the temperature (from the internal sensor ofcourse!) and some static text&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Connections are as follows(PORT1):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LCD5110_SCLK_PIN- BIT5&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LCD5110_DN_PIN- BIT7&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LCD5110_SCE_PIN- BIT0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LCD5110_DC_PIN- BIT1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/72070b40befcf1417e2a.js&quot;&gt; &lt;/script&gt;

   <title>Arduino Library for Freescale's MMA7361 3 axis accelerometer</title>
   <link href="http://rohitg.in/2014/11/03/Library-for-MMA7361/"/>
   <updated>2014-11-03T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
   <id>http://rohitg.in/2014/11/03/Library-for-MMA7361</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Accelerometers huh! No new term these days! Every &lt;strong&gt;practical&lt;/strong&gt; phone these days has one! Accelerometers churn out data in two ways :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Analog which can be directly read by our friendly ADC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Digital which send data in values riding on I2C/SPI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one that i had is an analog one and is probably the first one that comes when you search with keywords &lt;em&gt;Arduino Accelerometer&lt;/em&gt; on ebay/AliExpress. It(module) is based on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freescale.com/files/sensors/doc/data_sheet/MMA7361L.pdf&quot;&gt;Freescale &amp;#39;s MMA7361 analog 3Axis Accelerometer&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://deadbugelectronics.com/image/cache/data/Sensor/Acc_Gyro/MMA7361%20-%201-500x500.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Image&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bought it a while back and was curious to play with it. The pin description (thanks to the simplification done &lt;a href=&quot;http://eecs.oregonstate.edu/education/docs/accelerometer/MMA7361_module.pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;X,Y,Z&lt;/strong&gt; give Analog Voltage outputs based on the orientation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SL&lt;/strong&gt; - Sleep (needs to be Pulled up)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;0g&lt;/strong&gt; - It gives a signal when 0g is detected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5v,3v,GND&lt;/strong&gt; - Usual Power Connections 3V is produced internally if 5v is applied&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GS&lt;/strong&gt; - Sensitivity select- the IC allows 1.5g and 6g settings &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ST&lt;/strong&gt; - Self Test&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without doing the &lt;strong&gt;RTFD(D-Datasheet)&lt;/strong&gt; i quickly plugged in the board to read X values and to derive any conclusion and Alas! it failed.I then went thru the datasheet to find out the IC is initially in &lt;em&gt;Sleep&lt;/em&gt; Mode and has to be awaken by &lt;em&gt;pulling-Up&lt;/em&gt; the Sleep pin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just connect a &lt;code&gt;10k&lt;/code&gt; resistor to the Sleep Pin and to the 3.3V output pin and now we have most of the circuit set up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5614/15071754173_00038d914a.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;IMg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now just:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;read the analog values from the pin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;convert them to voltages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;apply sensitivity and correction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and get g value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simple as that!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having deciphered it, i wrote a test code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/1d5402b9b3562345cc44.js&quot;&gt; &lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It worked as designed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then i thought that it will be better to try writing a library for it and learn how to write libraries in the process.
The process turned out to be easy thanks to the documentation by &lt;strong&gt;Arduino&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My Library can be found here on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/IndianTinker/MMA7361Library&quot;&gt;github&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feel free to fork it and use it. 
Hoping the community finds it useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rohit &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Inside a Cheap LED Bulb</title>
   <link href="http://rohitg.in/2014/10/28/Dollar-LED-Bulb/"/>
   <updated>2014-10-28T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
   <id>http://rohitg.in/2014/10/28/Dollar-LED-Bulb</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was recently on the visit to my hometown &lt;em&gt;Delhi&lt;/em&gt; this Diwali when i visited &lt;strong&gt;Lajpat Rai&lt;/strong&gt; market, the sweet spot every maker in Delhi knows/visits. There while glancing through the tiny crowded streets i found a shop selling nice pretentious LED Bulbs at a pretty cheap price of about a Dollar (60 INR). The LED intensity was evenly spread, flicker of any sort was absent and 7W was promised. I bought a couple and went back home to take them apart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was pretty clear that the Bulbs wont have those &lt;em&gt;Chinese&lt;/em&gt; drivers that most Local Manufacturers use. They themselves cost around 20-25 INR and there is cost of LEDs, Metal PCB, Bulb casing and not to forget the labour. My next guess was it might contain those nicely tuned transformerless supplies that drain power across the resistor to get a lower voltage and the filter it to produce a not so clean DC Voltage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/15646628781&quot; title=&quot;WP_20141026_004 by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7507/15646628781_e2e377806e_z.jpg&quot; width=&quot;359&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; alt=&quot;WP_20141026_004&quot; align= &quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And Bingo!
It did have a textbook transformerless design (&lt;a href=&quot;4.bp.blogspot.com/-tOTZue-ocJc/T6H5mhgB1BI/AAAAAAAABPU/Ith1NLS,%20One%20can%20only%20gjnvg/s1600/transformerless+power+supply+circuit.png&quot;&gt;like this&lt;/a&gt;) on the PCB with almost no isolation except a small piece of cardboard and literally no regulation (&lt;em&gt;No Zener&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/15012068084&quot; title=&quot;#Inside a #OneDollar #LED #Bulb ! A Transformerless supply that is tuned to deliver correct V/I value. Quite Catastrophic in case of major #Fluctuations that we face in #Delhi. But what more can one expect for that price ! #MadeInIndia by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3935/15012068084_be8db3d3ca_n.jpg&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;320&quot; alt=&quot;#Inside a #OneDollar #LED #Bulb !

But what more can one expect for that price ! #MadeInIndia&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The entire Bulb had:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2x &lt;code&gt;470k&lt;/code&gt; resistors, &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 x &lt;code&gt;100uf&lt;/code&gt; Electrolytic Capacitor, &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 x &lt;code&gt;0.1uf&lt;/code&gt;(guess) Capacitor with severed markings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;12 LEDs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4 Diodes in bridge rectifier configuration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/15649322345&quot; title=&quot;WP_20141026_003 by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5607/15649322345_a9bccfbe51.jpg&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;281&quot; alt=&quot;WP_20141026_003&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bulb inspite of its circuit was quite bright and infact brighter than my quality 5W LED bulb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/15028564094&quot; title=&quot;WP_20141026_005 by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7494/15028564094_51bf7d42a9.jpg&quot; width=&quot;281&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; alt=&quot;WP_20141026_005&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One can only guess how long will this last, If the bulb faces the intense voltage fluctuations that Delhi Faces during summers , it will fail with no doubt. But still its great for the cost and the light it offers for whatever time it may do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Implementing Tags/Categories on Jekyll using Liquid !</title>
   <link href="http://rohitg.in/2014/10/21/Tags-on-Jekyll-Blog-using-liquid.md%20-Welcome-to-new-home/"/>
   <updated>2014-10-21T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
   <id>http://rohitg.in/2014/10/21/Tags-on-Jekyll-Blog-using-liquid.md -Welcome-to-new-home</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have recently been working on my blog on using &lt;em&gt;Jekyll&lt;/em&gt; on &lt;strong&gt;Github Pages&lt;/strong&gt; and the experience has been wonderful.&amp;lt;!--more--&amp;gt; It a lot easier than wordpress where I have to login and do all kinds of formatting to churn out a decent looking post. Here its just Markdown and some pre configurations and I just need to update a github repo at the end of it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, Jekyll supports &lt;a href=&quot;liquidmarkup.org/&quot;&gt;Liquid&lt;/a&gt; a templating engine built on ruby that is developed by e commerce giant &lt;em&gt;Shopify&lt;/em&gt;.
Using Liquid we can add some basic logic ( and maybe advance too) to the blog like categorization and tagging. Tagging is not available out of the box with Jekyll but can be implemented easily using &lt;strong&gt;Liquid&lt;/strong&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It essentially involves two steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Editing YML front matter (The thing between the 3 dashes)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating a Category page to automatically accumulate all the tags you added &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this the changes will be reflected on compilation. And Voila! You would have added tags to your blog!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets get started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add a &lt;code&gt;Tags&lt;/code&gt; variable to the frontmatter block and list the tags as shown the following example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;---
layout: post
title: Tagging Jekyll
tags:
- Jekyll
- Blogging
- web
---
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, create a page in the root or in whatever way you have configured Jekyll to pick new page and create a page say &lt;em&gt;Categories&lt;/em&gt; etc.
Lets name it Categories.md&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use the following snippet to display tags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/3eddb75957eaf9f9b8e8.js&quot;&gt; &lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;jekyll build
jekyll serve
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and see the changes in the blog on &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000&quot;&gt;http://localhost:4000&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.
If you face any issues be sure to comment here .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rohit&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I am now in process of migrating my main blog on &lt;a href=&quot;http://indiantinker.wordpress.com&quot;&gt;wordpress&lt;/a&gt; to github pages for more contexual/design/layout freedom. This blog is built using &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;:&amp;lt;!--more--&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory [...] and spits out a complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache or your favorite web server. This is also the engine behind GitHub Pages, which you can use to host your project’s page or blog right here from GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who have used &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.latex-project.org/&quot;&gt;LaTeX&lt;/a&gt; in the past Jekyll is excellent as it (personally saying) generates a static website by compiling all the code you wrote in the post.Obviously, with the luxury of &lt;strong&gt;platforms&lt;/strong&gt; like wordpress,blogspot etc writing bare code is archaic. Jekyll has got your back here too, you never &lt;em&gt;write&lt;/em&gt; the html/css tags from scratch. The Jekyll engine takes standard markdown which it builds into a html code and once built gives you a complete website. You an obviously code in html too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comments,widgets and Analytics work too with just a bit of playing required.
The comments on this site are supported via Disqus !&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope this post compiles well ! :)&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;CAUTION:This post might sound different. Writing gears need some oiling.
&amp;lt;!--more--&amp;gt;
I have moved to pune for work now and exploring the city has always been on my top agenda.  Pune has always been a happening city of makers. Mumbai is close-by and easily commutable. There are a lot of DIY/Maker start-ups here too and who doesnt know about IOTPune/DooThings. [A more detailed city review sometime later]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bored one night,thinking how to spend the weekend more constructively, i started to scroll through the meetups around my place on weekend. The main priority was &amp;quot;Distance&amp;quot; . People living in Pune can relate. The city transportation is awful and a thread is always running in mind querying, &amp;quot;Dude! Will be able to walk back? &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, I noticed Mozilla is organizing a big event near my place and there is no better way to spend the weekend. After visiting, MakerFest last year, I have really started to like these events.Anool(Sir) from MakersAsylum/Wyolum was coming with his team and so was IOTPune and so was Mark Surman from Mozilla and so were many others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stared to plan how to go at Symbiosis Centre for Computer Research, Here Transit comes to the rescue and i boarded the bus and got down at a nearby bus stop. Initial (rather first day) experience has taught me that we should have &amp;quot;Say No to Autos&amp;quot; banner erected everywhere in the city. This is more important than Polybag Awareness etc. if thought in a more citizen centric way. [Weekly, Auto Rant Ends.Stay tuned for more]. I walked another 800m and there i was at the venue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I entered the gate of the college. I was asked my credentials to check, if i registered. I had , so i went to see the workshops as they were listed on the website. I carried my OpenBadge [A no brains LED Matrix badge that i made for MakerFest but could&amp;#39;nt debug it completely] and some other projects too just in case someone like-minded crossed. Swag!
&lt;a title=&quot;OpenBadge by IndianTinker, on Flickr&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/15497565022/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5597/15497565022_027b3e70d3_c.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;OpenBadge&quot; width=&quot;777&quot; height=&quot;800&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went straight to the main hall and found it jam packed. So, i gave it a pass and went on visiting the booths. There were pretty interesting things showcased. Let start the Booth WATCH:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Makers Asylum was present with all guns blazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Banners by IndianTinker, on Flickr&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/15311177590/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3950/15311177590_1709f2f304_c.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Banners&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;449&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
The Word Clock was at display.

&lt;p&gt;Samarth from Melting Mints who works with the Makers Asylum showed some mind blowing applications of 3D Printing. This is a human skull printed from a scan.

&lt;p&gt;A 3D printed Music Instrument and a Car that is so awesomely finished.
&lt;a title=&quot;Does 3D Printing sound good? by IndianTinker, on Flickr&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/15311318067/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5600/15311318067_110c8480c5_c.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Does 3D Printing sound good?&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;449&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When asked if he can print custom parts and more specifically 3D Printer parts. He said, Why not? Plus he does it economically too for students willing to start printing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pipe Lamp
&lt;a title=&quot;The #PipeLamp by @makersasylum at @Mozilla #MakerParty #Pune #India #MakerWeekend #Makers #DIY by IndianTinker, on Flickr&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/14976643067/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5588/14976643067_0c475d48cb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The #PipeLamp by @makersasylum at @Mozilla #MakerParty #Pune #India #MakerWeekend #Makers #DIY&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also had a few 3D pens for visitors to play with.

&lt;p&gt;In the next booth, An interesting thing was up for display. A Smartphone and a DSLR ? Connect the dots and you get the triggertrap.
It translates the audio out from a SmartPhone into DSLR jack signals to do interesting stuff. Intervalometers, Event activated clicks.. You say it and app does it all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way to the second floor, I met Nishant Modak of IOT Pune.He too is(was) suffering from HP Laptop Syndrome and we talked a bit about his Makerspace in Pune called DoThings. He is doing a Pan America trip visiting MakerFaires with his team.

&lt;p&gt;He accompanied me to their booth where Anuj was giving a talk about Tah!
&lt;a title=&quot;@anujdeshpande giving a #Talk on #InternetOfThings at @mozilla #MakerParty in #Pune #India by IndianTinker, on Flickr&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/15165142252/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5594/15165142252_1f8acdcb9c_z.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;@anujdeshpande giving a #Talk on #InternetOfThings at @mozilla #MakerParty in #Pune #India&quot; width=&quot;612&quot; height=&quot;612&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They do great things at their MakerSpace which is verrrrry far from my place(Remember the thread). I saw an Intel Galileo which they had brought.
&lt;a title=&quot;Yes!

&lt;p&gt;It was time to go. As i traveled back, I thought of various things like Autowalas, 3D Printing , Makerfaires and of course Food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers!

   <title>The Hyderabad Quickie !</title>
   <link href="http://rohitg.in/2014/07/24/Hyderabad/"/>
   <updated>2014-07-24T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
   <id>http://rohitg.in/2014/07/24/Hyderabad</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was recently in South Indian city of Hyderabad, the capital of Andhra Pradesh (Now reorganized into two states called Telangana and Seemandhra ). The city is know for its Biryani and Char Minar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due the schedule , i could only get a day (rather a combination of one evening and one morning ) to explore  the Nawabi city. Thankfully, the city has an awesome public transportation system with buses and feeders plying to every nook and corner of the city. On the iteneary, we planned to visit Golconda Fort, Hussain Sagar, Char Minar and adjoining area and Banjara Hills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, we were based around Medhipatnam area, which provided easy access to most of the above places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weather here was a bit cooler and moist than my home Delhi, which was literally breaking all time temperature records. Hyderabad is a densely populated city. Unlike most south indian cities, due to the large Muslim population who speak Urdu, there is no problem for a Hindi speaking tourist here. The state predominantly speaks Telugu and has some &amp;quot;super-awesome-Newton-defying&amp;quot; movies,some of which i watched during the bus route from Chennai to Hyderabad.
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;#Hyderabad #Ramzan #Mosque #India #Travel by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/14346467217&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3912/14346467217_03878e7626.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;#Hyderabad #Ramzan #Mosque #India #Travel&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Since, Golconda was nearest , we boarded the bus that dropped us at the gate of Golconda Fort. The Fort seemed massive. It seemed to have some features of both Hindu and Muslim architectural elements which confused me about its origins.At the entry, there is an interesting demonstration, that a couple of guides will give you like a &amp;quot;30- Day Anti virus Trial&amp;quot; . In the middle of section after the entry, when you clap , a lot of beats are generated that can be heard at different &lt;strong&gt;strategic&lt;/strong&gt; parts of the Fort that were used as a signal. But when you move a few steps away from the centre, no beats are heard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some pretty cool sound engineering from the past. These are generated due to these structures on the roof above.
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Beat Generation Mechanism at Golconda Fort by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/14630690493&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3852/14630690493_f40566d0e6_c.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Beat Generation Mechanism at Golconda Fort&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;449&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
We bought a paper guide and started following the tour it promised. As we moved we saw this place where soldiers used to rest and take positions.Quite a popular picture spot it seems.

As we moved on, we approached a point where we had to start our journey of 350 stairs to reach to the top of the fort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I saw some interesting thing on the stairs. There were marks on the stairs with a yellow background and red finger marks on all of them.
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Stairs at Golconda Fort by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/14587642846&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5472/14587642846_c8bef07ab6_c.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Stairs at Golconda Fort&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;449&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
When asked from a passer-by he explained that this is a part of ritual performed here as there is a temple on the top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we climbed, the air started to get a bit cooler and fresher. We could see the Fort is mostly in ruins and most of the things that it presumably had are only in books or in the guides like the one i had in my hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we moved up stairs, we saw a mosque which was closed to visitors. There was also a jail which has an interesting story. It is said that, there the &lt;em&gt;Munshi&lt;/em&gt; ( The Head of Accounts) of the king was once held there because he paid from the coffers to help build a temple without the kings permission. Then after several years, God came in king&amp;#39;s dream and asked him to free him. He was freed that very night. There is a temple there now.

Next, we moved to the top most point we could see the bigger picture. Most structures were in shambles. Here is the panorama from the top most point .
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Golconda Fort Panaroma by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/14607376441&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3856/14607376441_1e5c9067cb_c.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Golconda Fort Panaroma&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;205&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

From the top, we could see the entire city of hyderabad. We caught a person vandalising the walls and asked him to stop. He ran away, but as we were decending we saw him writing with a charcoal on the walls of the place where the king&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;Darbar&lt;/em&gt; meetings were held.

As we descended, we could see ruined arches and rooms that once housed the dignitaries of the king.

Below, is the room where the queen(S) used to live.

Next we moved to the place where artillery was stored. These large iron balls were propelled by cannons apart from the famous hot oil protection scheme to save the fort. I remember, the hot oil was also used to protect Kangra Fort, in Himachal Pradesh.
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Artillery at Fort by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/14610572335&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2897/14610572335_a09ca59525_c.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Artillery at Fort&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;449&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
After this fort walk, we exited the complex and moved to the Bus Stand and sipped a couple of tender coconuts while we waited for the bus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next we moved to the Hussain Sagar Lake, Again we got a direct bus leading to the lake&amp;#39;s gate. Like the fort, the lake was huge. So, huge that there were ferries running in the lake to take visitors to the large statue of Lord Buddha. There is a small amusement park that has been set up for kids.

The ferries take 5-10min and drop you at the Statue where you can stay as long as you want and catch any ferry back. The statue is decorated with beautiful lights.

After spending some time there, we made a quick exit and caught the next bus to the Epic Charminar. With thoughts of Biriyani for which i have been running almost empty stomach  i boarded the bus.It took us about 30 minutes to reach. A couple of minutes of walk, an there stood the Charminar.
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Busy Streets near Char Minar by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/14587711756&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3904/14587711756_03cf3a2853_c.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Busy Streets near Char Minar&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;449&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
This was not the correct time to visit the place. It was jam packed. The streets has shops selling pearls, fruits, clothes and bakery items. We moved closer.
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Char Minar by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/14424080170&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5582/14424080170_fe8936a715_c.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Char Minar&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;449&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
The crowd density increased. We could now see the Char minar a bit clearly, The site was highly polluted. The vehicles were running too close to the monument and the pollutants were quite evidently damaging the monument.

We say an interesting site that depicted, the diversity in our country. A Temple inside a Char Minar. #ProudIndian
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;It happens only in India. A Temple in a Mosque by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/14424111429&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5507/14424111429_a683ff8315_c.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;It happens only in India. A Temple in a Mosque&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;449&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
The issue was Biriyani. We searched the famous shops but none of them served Vegetarian Biriyani. One person suggested us, to go to a shop down the lane and supposedly the only one to serve veg biriyani. Ah! Delighted :)
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Hyderabadi Biryani (VEG) :) by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/14610680935&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3840/14610680935_ab04c6c41b_c.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Hyderabadi Biryani (VEG) :)&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;449&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Biriyani is like pulao but with an overdose of clove, cinammon and some secret ingredients . After having this delicious Biriyani, we started our way back to the Hotel. On the way we stopped at Banjara Hills, Its the CP of Hyderabad, picked up a Sundae and headed back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you visit the CharMinar area and Banjara Hills in the order, you would see how the country is moving forward, Preserving the culture and the soul of its existence as well as We are going in hand with the more developed outlook and are leading the world in some things!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers :)&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Tiano- The Touchscreen Piano</title>
   <link href="http://rohitg.in/2014/04/16/Tiano-Piano/"/>
   <updated>2014-04-16T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
   <id>http://rohitg.in/2014/04/16/Tiano-Piano</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Touchscreens..huh.. They are all around us..Phones ,tablets, phablets and now even laptops. Most of them have a capacitive touchscreen where the change in capacitance at a point is used to sense it and then perform the corresponding action. Capacitive ones are multi point sensing. They sense more than 2 points and hence we get those pinch to zoom features etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand , almost archaic version on touchscreen is the resistive version. That are pretty easy to interface with almost any microcontroller with an ADC. In this project i did over the weekend i tried to interface a touchscreen ( resistive one..) ,available at mobile repair shops in Delhi with a MSP430G2553 (Although MSP430G2231 would also do)  to make a piano.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://indiantinker.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/touchscreen-setup.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-339&quot; alt=&quot;Touchscreen setup&quot; src=&quot;http://indiantinker.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/touchscreen-setup.jpg&quot; width=&quot;470&quot; height=&quot;230&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pre-requisites&lt;/strong&gt;: The touchscreen may not be easier to get. I got mine from a mobile repair shop in LR. It is a 4-wire Touchscreen, pretty common with horribly thin contacts that took a lot of patience to solder.There is a lot of literature available on Touchscreens on the internet. I found two app notes that were best. First one from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.atmel.in/Images/doc8091.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Atmel&lt;/a&gt; , that explained the working of the touchsreen in a pretty clear way and one from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ti.com/lit/an/slaa384a/slaa384a.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;TI&lt;/a&gt; that some what helped in the software part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You must read the atmel one ( atleast the first few pgs to get how it works). Its essentially a resistive voltage divider. The value of the touch point is determined by the ADC value read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://indiantinker.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/post1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-338&quot; alt=&quot;formula&quot; src=&quot;http://indiantinker.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/post1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;470&quot; height=&quot;264&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the illustration above(borrowed from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ti.com/lit/an/slaa384a/slaa384a.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;TI App Note&lt;/a&gt;). One can easily see how the co-ordinates are read. In order to find out, what wire on your touch sreen corresponds to X and Y meshes. You can use a multi-meter first to measure the resistance between pins ,usually the alternate pins belong to same axes. in my case it was X-,Y-,X+,Y+  then to differentiate between x and y , one probable method will be to power the touchscreen i.e. giving the drive voltage and then find out the voltage at any other terminal w.r.t. ground and see whether is changing horizontally or vertically in your reference plane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CAUTION: Be careful about the current while powering the touchscreen externally!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this coding part is pretty simple. For the algo refer to page no.7 on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ti.com/lit/an/slaa384a/slaa384a.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;TI App Note&lt;/a&gt;. If you plan to run your end application on a battery and you have hard-coded the co-ordinates and the Vdrive is sourced externally i suggest that you sample the Vdrive as well . If you are using  microcontroller pins to supply Vdrive then this can be neglected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a desire to learn to play music but unfortunately due to my low patience levels , i have failed to keep up. :D&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, i made this Piano using the MSP430 Launchpad and a touchscreen along with a speaker. The code algo is pretty same as TI App Note Suggests and i encourage the reader to code it himself . Any difficulties can be discussed. It uses the&lt;a href=&quot;http://indiantinker.wordpress.com/2012/11/29/tone-library-for-msp430/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; tone library&lt;/a&gt; i posted earlier to generate the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solf%C3%A8ge&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;solfeggio&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;h1 id=&quot;firstHeading&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:13px;&quot;&gt;Here is the shaky and horrible video i made:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Open Agitator</title>
   <link href="http://rohitg.in/2014/04/07/OpenAgitator/"/>
   <updated>2014-04-07T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
   <id>http://rohitg.in/2014/04/07/OpenAgitator</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After a somewhat woeful week at college that shook my belief in several sectors.. I mustered up my courage to realize an old project they knocked the door every time i used to Etch PCB boards. Since, the solution i use has already done close to 20 boards of small size one has to really keep shaking/stirring/Agitating the solution for a fairy long time.. ( ya 7-8 mins of man power is fairly long time :P )&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea came to me when i visited my brother in &lt;a title=&quot;Travelogue: Bangalore&quot; href=&quot;http://indiantinker.wordpress.com/2013/05/24/travelogue-bangalore/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bangalore&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year. He was generous enough to give us a tour of his world class Biotechnology lab in India.. He showed us stuff and things/instruments which were difficult to pronounce in one go but they all had a thing in common- They ended with syllables like -&lt;em&gt;&amp;#39;-izer&amp;#39;,-&amp;#39;ator&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;-ation&amp;#39;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that they used for not allowing things/particles to sediment was called a shaker. It would be great if i could get one for myself that will take the work out of etching. When i returned i made an over-killed 3D model of the agitator that i had in mind. It would just be a 1-axis CNC with a stepper motor and belt, That was doing a lot for the task..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some pics of the model:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://indiantinker.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/etchinator2.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-488&quot; alt=&quot;Looks Cool Though.. &quot; src=&quot;http://indiantinker.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/etchinator2.jpg&quot; width=&quot;570&quot; height=&quot;514&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Looks Cool Though..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://indiantinker.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/etchinator1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-487&quot; alt=&quot;Freewheel mount and stepper motor&quot; src=&quot;http://indiantinker.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/etchinator1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;633&quot; height=&quot;466&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Freewheel mount and stepper motor&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Realizing the overkill design, I went on to an easier one earlier this month ( actually previous month ) when a relative who was &amp;#39;demolishing&amp;#39; his old PC gave me some old CDROMs that didn`t work. The mechanics did work though..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I just &amp;#39;damaged&amp;#39; the tracks around the main feed motor and attached my own custom circuit based around the MSP430 micro-controller and majority of TI parts as they can be shipped to anyone  with an address making it very easy to re build yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a proof-of-concept video i posted a while back where the Etchinator ( now Open Agitator after i realized it could do a lot more like cooling hot milk  :D ) was etching its own control board  :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/wOFcjrQe-is&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used a L293D H bridge motor controller to control the forward and backward movement of the cradle with an adjustable speed by giving a PWM on the Enable Pin . People who had made LFR&amp;#39;s in the first/second year know its a child`s play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After running the aforementioned set up for a while i noticed that  the cradle would shift to the farther end where the gear was slightly worn out. So, when loaded the cradle would :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Latch on to that part and stay stuck.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The whole system would move a bit forward each time and latch on the wrong part.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, an end-stop detection was required which would keep the cradle in the fixed portion.. some what similar to the ones i had seen in the CNC`s which tell them their legitimate playing fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer was using the old mouse push button that came with the CD-ROM. Its softer and probably made to withstand greater number of press-cycles than a standard SPST Tactile switch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So , now the logic would work like, whenever the button/EndStop is pressed, the direction will be reversed for a fixed time and then reversed again.. So, the cycle keeps on going.. .. .. ..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the final  schematic i came up with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://indiantinker.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/sche.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-492&quot; alt=&quot;Schematic&quot; src=&quot;http://indiantinker.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/sche.png&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; height=&quot;482&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Schematic&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since, i did&amp;#39;nt wanted to leave any pins un-used i included 3 LED`s which show the different states of the agitator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The power supply needs special mention as it converts from a standard 12V DC adapter to 5V for the logic of the bridge (L293D) and again an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ti.com/product/lp2950-33&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;LDO LP2950-3.3V&lt;/a&gt; for the MSP430. The LDO can be sampled from TI and 7805 is available locally with every tinkerer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even the driver i.e &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ti.com/product/l293d&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;L293D&lt;/a&gt; can be sourced from Ti. The brain of the device is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ti.com/product/msp430g2231&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;MSP430G2231&lt;/a&gt; also sampled from TI and programmed from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ti.com/tool/msp-exp430g2&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;MSP430 Launchpad&lt;/a&gt;. So, This project was indirectly sponsored by TI :D&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next came the board layout.. I designed it to have the least number of  vias (They can be a pain sometimes) while fitting at the back of the CD-ROM. Here is the one with just two vias.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://indiantinker.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/brd.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-493&quot; alt=&quot;Board!&quot; src=&quot;http://indiantinker.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/brd.png&quot; width=&quot;458&quot; height=&quot;205&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Board&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since, the position of motor/EndStop switches were flexible they eased out the routing a bit. You can also add a DC Jack to it if you like. The files are available on github &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/IndianTinker/OpenAgitator&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are pictures of the final build i managed to pull off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://indiantinker.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/dsc00522.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-497&quot; alt=&quot;The EndStop&quot; src=&quot;http://indiantinker.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/dsc00522.jpg&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; height=&quot;525&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The EndStop&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://indiantinker.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/dsc00515.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-499&quot; alt=&quot;All in Place&quot; src=&quot;http://indiantinker.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/dsc00515.jpg&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; height=&quot;444&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; All in Place&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://indiantinker.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/dsc00516.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-500&quot; alt=&quot;Scratchy Soldering&quot; src=&quot;http://indiantinker.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/dsc00516.jpg&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; height=&quot;476&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Scratchy Soldering&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://indiantinker.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/dsc00517.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-501&quot; alt=&quot;Power Test Complete&quot; src=&quot;http://indiantinker.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/dsc00517.jpg&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; height=&quot;505&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Power Test Complete&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://indiantinker.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/dsc00521.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-503&quot; alt=&quot;Fixed to the back of the CDROM&quot; src=&quot;http://indiantinker.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/dsc00521.jpg&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; height=&quot;525&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Fixed to the back of the CDROM&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next thing that was left was to give it a sturdy base. I choose two planks of wood that were lying around. It was essential to leave it without any base on the middle section as if &amp;#39;ever&amp;#39; there is a chemical spill that can be cleaned without unscrewing the entire assembly!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, Here is the final build :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://indiantinker.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/dsc00520.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-502&quot; alt=&quot;Final Build&quot; src=&quot;http://indiantinker.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/dsc00520.jpg&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; height=&quot;525&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Final Build&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can fork the complete code and design from my&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/IndianTinker/OpenAgitator&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; github repo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a video of me explaining the build.. Please ignore the following :
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Bad camera quality&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Some goof-ups with the IC names.. Keep an eye on the Sub Titles/Captions&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Background Noise (if any)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope you like it and build one for yourself..

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Gujrati Food.. Umm .If you love gujrati food in which ever part of the country you are and then go and visit Ahmadabad for some reason and eat those &amp;quot;Jalebi, Fafda&amp;quot; or Khandvi, I bet your entire &amp;quot;Gujrati Food here(at your place) is good&amp;quot; notion will be changed and you will abstain from eating Gujju Food anywhere else. It has been Months and i haven&amp;#39;t eaten my favorite Khandvi. Its also so pirated here in Delhi. Well.. Food Piracy !&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this travelogue I will go through my adventurous journey into the food and people of Amdavad (as they say there). We were recently there for &lt;a title=&quot;MakerFest 2014&quot; href=&quot;http://indiantinker.wordpress.com/2014/01/25/makerfest-2014-roundup/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;MakerFest &lt;/a&gt; and in whatever time we got I and my group consisting Of Ishan and Saral sneaked into the city to explore be it late night (1am-ish) or early morning! What i am going to illustrate was done in bits and pieces , but surprisingly can be done in one full day! So, the below log can be done chronologically but was done in 2 days due to other important tasks :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were based out of Nehru Nagar. So most delicious shops were located nearby. If you plan to roam around next day, try eating something light in dinner as the next day will be &amp;quot;Heavy&amp;quot; .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We woke a early( well 10:30am it was i guess) and reached the famous &amp;#39;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/place/Juna+Sherbazar/@23.0218518,72.5432173,21z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x5a8ad26931ddbf1c&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Juna Sherbazaarwalla&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39; for his jalebi fafda combo. Fafda is made out of besan and is usually eaten with green chillis. But imagine if you combine the three. Its an atomic combination, Sweet, salty and spicy -3S ! We saw a local person, on the road sitting on his 80&amp;#39;s Lambeda Scooter and savoring Kadhi also along with 3S&amp;#39;s . So we ordered it too. And it added more ammo to the stuff. Kadhi was a bit sweeter and less salty. We ended up ordering Dhokla too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Best Jalebi in town by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/11982146306&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7424/11982146306_2a074daeb6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Best Jalebi in town&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;281&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a title=&quot;Yum! by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/11981303585&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5527/11981303585_4c160bf0a3_b.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Yum!&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;575&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The best algo is Jalebi in one hand and fafda in another and then dip fafda in kadhi and eat the jalebi first and then fafda. Loop until you drop!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I dont like spices a lot. So, i avoided the chillis. Ishan loved it and posed for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Bas kar! by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/11981275295&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3666/11981275295_cdaecc9e8c.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bas kar!&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;281&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I browsed the shop and found some other interesting stuff as well. &lt;em&gt;Jee Lalchaye Raha na jaye&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;a title=&quot;Make that 4 by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/11981701944&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7420/11981701944_2f112e3cd5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Make that 4&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;281&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Ji Lalchahe Raha na jaye! by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/11981595643&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5534/11981595643_549dfc391d.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Ji Lalchahe Raha na jaye!&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;281&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They were basically all dhokla&amp;#39;s and Samosa but a bit sweeter and nice. Not to say we tasted them as well. We were fortunate enough to be in Gujrat at the time of Uttaran which is when you can get the famous Undio (Dish) and see Gujrat in its full colors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Round 3 by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/11981675694&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7430/11981675694_5d0c133bd0.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Round 3&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;281&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next we moved to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/place/Das+Khaman+House/@23.021278,72.543526,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x395e84dc3fffffff:0x8df081f249aca5ed&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Khaman Shop&lt;/a&gt;! On the same road as Juna Sharebazaar walla , but a little further. Khaman is similar to Dhokla. But I couldn&amp;#39;t understand whats the difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;The Khaman Shop by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/11981613945&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2850/11981613945_d743dfe220.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Khaman Shop&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;281&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Undio is basically a very spicy but tasty vegetable dish. It contains a lot of oil (I dont know why). But it was very tasty. It had Potatoes,Coriander and lot of other veggies i dont remember. Avoid this is you hate Oil and Chilly.
&lt;a title=&quot;Undio by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/11981253235&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3679/11981253235_963fe66719.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Undio&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;281&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Then we had the Khaman. It was just Awwwwesome! There was a nice tinge of garlic and sweetness i haven&amp;#39;t noticed anywhere. There is also a female version of Khaman called Khamani. Its a bit more crunchy and Spicy.It has tasty besan bhujia sprinkled over it and served with yellow chutney. Yummy..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/11981653504&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2880/11981653504_fc80ed1a2f.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Khaman Dhokla&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;281&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Khaman Dhokla&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/11981938053&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5547/11981938053_9a50556dd0.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Khamani&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;281&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Khamani&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS: Just before you start suspecting me of over-eating. This was eaten by a group of 3 :P&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With our input buffer almost full. We couldn&amp;#39;t order full plates of stuff we saw in the shop and were happily obliged by the shop owner who gave us some taste samples!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/11981609385&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7359/11981609385_c75dd5c739.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Taste Samples- Dhokla,Khandvi and Barfi Dhokla&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;281&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Yellow- Khandvi, White-Green- Dhokla, White-Barfi Dhokla&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shop has almost 20 Different types of Dhoklas. Wow!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since, our stomachs needed some rest. We needed to sneak out to some place of fun and walk.We headed on to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kankaria+Lake/@23.006353,72.6018539,18z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x395e85c51048cefb:0x777f51782a8b7a1a&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kankaria Lake&lt;/a&gt;. As always, prefer Local BRTS which is quite an efficient way to go around the city. Public Transport is always better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Kankaria Lake by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/11982381816&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7415/11982381816_70bb895550.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Kankaria Lake&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;281&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The lake is a pretty huge one, with a lot of things around it like Toy Train around the circumference, Fish Museum , Eating Stalls,Speed Boating, A Hot Air Balloon Ride,Kids in plastic balls that dont sink ( I dont know what its called :) ) and a ATV track with Polaris quads meant for kids below 12 ( :/ )&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Train Ride was pretty good. Good &amp;#39;ol Days as kids were revisited. Beware the Train Driver can yell at you if you get off the running train.It doesnt go over 12kmph.So, we did got over at Fish Museum. Hahaha.. DONT TRY THIS!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Fish Museum  was pretty nice. Its a two floor museum with lots of different fishes on display.I dont eat fishes (Vegetarian) and don&amp;#39;t know many fish names other than Piranha ( Piranha 3D :P ) , gold fish ( Childhood stories), Sharks (Jaws) and Turtles. All of them were present there. Happy to meet you in person guys! We also did a little experiment to see if fishes react to Jazz Music. Conclusion: Well Some do, Some Don&amp;#39;t!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After our input buffer almost empty, we though of eating ; Whats better than Vada Pav. We ordered Vada Pav at the local stall on the lake! It was pretty bad. Some famous person has said, &amp;quot; Chilli is the mask of a bad cook&amp;quot; . The Vada Pav was filled with Chilli. This is a pretty old street food trick when they sell water/drinks by selling spicy food. Busted!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then had some ice-cream from the &amp;quot;What-we-thought-local&amp;quot; shop called Havmor. But it was some real bang on buck. Totally awesome! There was no Kwality Walls, Cream Bell or Mother Dairy there but Havmor was infact a chain of Ice-Cream Parlors Spread across city.The Raja--Rani flavor ice cream is pretty good, just in case you have trouble choosing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was now time to leave this pleasant lake and move to some godly place. ISKCON Temple was the place. There is a bus stand outside Kankaria Lake and you can get direct bus to ISKCON Temple. We passed over the Sabarmati Lake front and captured this beautiful sunset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://indiantinker.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/wp_20140106_034.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-632&quot; src=&quot;http://indiantinker.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/wp_20140106_034.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;WP_20140106_034&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; height=&quot;393&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took us quite a while to reach there. People were happy to help us when we wanted. Good People always smiling! We reached ISKCON Temple near the time of arti and as always the ISKCON Temple Arti is pretty hair raising! We paid our tribute to Lord Krishna and stayed there for a while. Bliss!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then after the ARTI was over, we had the prasad and went outside, collected our shoes and ate chinese samosas. This is a pretty standard &amp;#39;delicacy&amp;#39; in any Indian Marriage. Its basically a Indianized Fried Wonton and is served with Momo Sauce. Still better than that Vada Pav!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Question was now what? Go to the BaseCamp or Go somewhere else? Obviously Go somewhere else, But where? We were suggested by a person to do visit the &amp;quot;Drive-In Cinema&amp;quot; . Its probably there in two Indian cities Mumbai and Ahemdabad. So, why not! Bus Route is way out of question suggested Here Drive. We took the Auto to &amp;quot;Drive In Cinema&amp;quot;. It basically a place where you can Drive into a large ground with your car and watch the movie out of the car itself. The Screen was huuuuuggggeee ! Dhoom-3 was being played. We joined in. Its a great experience but even if you dont have a car, there is a small auditorium built near the projection room that can accommodate you!

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were small poles with built in speaker and Amps too, because if they had a central amp, then those long wires load the central amp a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We enjoyed the movie and had &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dabeli&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Dabeli&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; during the interval. It was way better than that Vada Pao and Standard Pop Corn. Its a type of Vada Pao only but a bit different.I guess they dont use Besan in the tikki/vada they have inside it. Prefer a butter Dabeli if you have an option.Below is the picture captured when the butter was smoked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Dabeli by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/11981869243&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3696/11981869243_cf98177a93_b.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Dabeli&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; height=&quot;575&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a bit spicy, but the chutney neutralized some of it. But the time the movie was over. We were hungry! Damm Hungry. We took an auto to Nehru Circle. It was 10pm so night charges apply! We asked the auto person to drop us off the circle as well. We found another good shop!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It served the best Vada Pao and Khasta Samosa Ever!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;The Best Vada Pao in Town by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/11981666803&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3728/11981666803_b85b29bf4a.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Best Vada Pao in Town&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;281&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shop owner was a pretty nice lad. He was from Rajasthan and was very much patriotic about Gujrat and kept on repeating &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Aap humare Gujrat mein aaye ho&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;. When asked about NaMo his words were sweeter than the Jalebi we had in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ate Vada Pao and Samosa! The Vada Pao ( i am a fan boy of ) was a bit different than the one i had in Dadar,Mumbai near Siddhivinyak which is rather advertorial to be the best in Mumbai. It was spicy but good but this one was the best! 10/10 . When asked about the secret, he said he has a special chutney which uses Khumani (I guess). If you love Vada Pao go here! Its near Nehru Circle and opens till late!

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Samosa by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/11980933665&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7293/11980933665_e34f63ffba.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Samosa&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;281&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The samosa was also good. But it was the chutney that had all the magic!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next we moved to a Pizza Shop-Real Paparika. Unlike Dominoes or Pizza Hut in Delhi, Amdavad has a lot of there joints which are essentially home-grown Italian Food Chains. Since we were half full, so we ordered the 4 pizza Combo! Surprisingly they have an unlimited food combo for 129 INR.
&lt;a title=&quot;Late Night Pizza by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/11981862673&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7401/11981862673_06a6a1142c.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Late Night Pizza&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;281&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well the pizza was good. But not surprising.It was comparable in quality to Dominoes and far well prepared but was pretty basic! Next we moved to the local soda parlor to have some late night soda! The soda shop had a chach flavored soda that was worth trying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Soda by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/11981758264&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3796/11981758264_ef93326923.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Soda&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;281&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we drank the soda , we could see city getting ready for Uttarayan. Kite thread ( Manja) was being glazed with glass and various different kites were being made.Too bad we wont be in the city on the day! But there is always a next time.
&lt;a title=&quot;Manja by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/11981251753&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7364/11981251753_045f4d54e7.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Manja&quot; width=&quot;281&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Sada Haq Aithe Rakh Patang by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/11981334655&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2821/11981334655_ac0464cb28.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Sada Haq Aithe Rakh Patang&quot; width=&quot;281&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we were walking towards our apartment, we thought about various things, the people&amp;#39;s love for the city, NaMo, Food and It was never a bad time for some late night ice cream. Ice Cream anyone?
&lt;a title=&quot;Havmor Ice Cream by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/11981463926&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7368/11981463926_dfb293092c.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Havmor Ice Cream&quot; width=&quot;281&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;આવ્જો (āvjo)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rohit&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: There is a bit more to Ahemadabad - The Sabarmati Ashram, Vintage Car Museum, Science City and Delux Gujrati Thali ! Maybe next time ! :D&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Arduino Controlware- Play with your duino without frequent code uploads</title>
   <link href="http://rohitg.in/2012/08/25/Arduino-Controlware/"/>
   <updated>2012-08-25T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
   <id>http://rohitg.in/2012/08/25/Arduino-Controlware</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I had a bit of an experience developing GUI`s and Data Visualization in Processing.Processing is very cool to work with and the designs are highly scale-able. There are tons and tons of separate examples and libraries available for processing especially the Serial Library which eases the task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this week , i tried to make myself a GUI using Visual C#. It was a really great experience.Although you can make buttons in processing too..but its a lot easier in Visual C# Express.However, it seems not many DIY`ers use C# and its used mainly by hardcore coders and developers..but still i managed to find some cool references via MSDN and a demo(of his work) by my friend to put together a simple and easy way to talk to Arduino on a windows machine!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can monitor Analog Inputs , control digital pins and connect to the COM Port of your choice.Since i am still building upon it.So i am leaving a gist of how the GUI/program currently looks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://indiantinker.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/controlware.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-198&quot; title=&quot;ControlWare&quot; src=&quot;http://indiantinker.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/controlware.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;470&quot; height=&quot;417&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will see that the Digital Pin 13 is missing. Actually i have used it to indicate an Active Serial Session.This makes it a lot easier while debugging.
&lt;iframe src=&quot;//player.vimeo.com/video/50615424&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;375&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: 02 Oct&amp;#39;12 : Thank You Guys for appreciating my work!I gave the same to few of my folks at my college for beta testing. Here is the link to the final executable on Windows Only!
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;ControlWare&quot; href=&quot;http://sdrv.ms/VonGvI&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ControlWare.exe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:left;&quot;&gt;The Arduino Code To be uploaded is :                                                     &lt;a href=&quot;http://sdrv.ms/UtUu5Y&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:left;&quot;&gt;Some of FAQ`s are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;There is no Digital13 on this as it is meant to signify an active Serial Connection.i.e whether the computer is communicating with Arduino or not.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;You have to find out the correct COM Port from Device Manager and enter that with Caps On&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;This is a VegBurgerWare ( coz i dont drink beer).So if i find u using it.You owe me a burger :P&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Its not Cross Compatible..works best on Windows Only&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
