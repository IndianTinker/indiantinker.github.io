        BoardMerge- The command line single page PDF merge utility for PCBs
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">17 Apr 2015</span>

    <p>Toner Transfer Method.. is no doubt sheer Awesomeness. With just a few steps you can have your prototype in your hands without waiting for weeks for the fab house to deliver. Certainly relieves me of a lot of anxiety. I even made this <a href="http://rohitg.in/2014/04/07/OpenAgitator/">Open Agitator</a> a while back to help me ease out the etching process.</p>

<p>I usually (used to) print my designs on the glossy photopaper near my college where there is a usual hub of shops catering to student needs. Carrying the photopapers from my house to the college in the crowded metro would often crumble them. I preferred buying them from the local stationary shops near the college itself who would sell it at varying prices anachronistically.</p>

<p>The shop used to charge for a round of paper into the printer (actually one print) and if i printed multiple on the same sheet, if was charged more. As students we <em>should</em> cut costs. Further the <em>several-times-on-a-page</em> approach had more issues:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Printing on a sheet many times causes it to blacken due to the unhealthy state of drum on public printers</li>
  <li>The shop keeper usually charges for a single round in the printer and printing many times added to the costs.</li>
  <li>I had to always mark the point for the orientation of the print, else if the print goes the other way again, i can have the next file printed on the previous file , rendering the entire excercise useless. Actually that has happened twice :)</li>
  <li>You also need to set the no scaling option in <em>Acrobat</em> again and again.. duh..</li>
</ul>

<p>Thats too much work specially after waiting in a queue to get to the printer !</p>

<p>I actually never thought of getting out of this circle for a while until the last few semesters, which were less academically demanding. I then wrote a small python script to combine all the pages that i used to print seperately to a <strong>Single</strong> page and then go and just print one pdf. No worries about messing up the orientation/scaling etc..</p>

<p>Well.. Why python when i could have used any photo-editing tool? Its simpler and automatic and I had once messed around the scale on a photo-editing tool and had to <em>re-etch (just imagine)</em> a whole board.</p>

<p><strong>The Process</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Like usual ways instead of directly printing files to printer, print them to pdf and choose different locations like center, top, left etc or you may also manually do that using the margins.Make sure that they dont overlap.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This way you will have many pdfs on the same folder. Now:
<code class="highlighter-rouge">git clone https://github.com/IndianTinker/BoardMerge.git</code>  or download from <a href="https://github.com/IndianTinker/BoardMerge">here</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You need to install pyPDF dependency. PIP is the boss here!
<code class="highlighter-rouge">sudo pip install pypdf</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now paste the <code class="highlighter-rouge">merge.py</code> in the active eagle folder and run :
<code class="highlighter-rouge">python merge.py file1.pdf file2.pdf .. .. ..</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Wait till it gets completed and you shall see a file <code class="highlighter-rouge">Combine.pdf</code> with all the pdfs on a single page!</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>This a directory full of 17 pdfs !</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/16557649863" title="before by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8693/16557649863_6f433269af_z.jpg" width="640" height="402" alt="before" /></a></p>

<p>After some python-fu you get this:</p>

<p>Hoping that fellow makers find it useful.</p>

        The Noob's Guide to Pune Relocation
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">12 Apr 2015</span>

    <p>It has almost been 8 months since i moved to Pune for Work from my hometown <em>Delhi</em> . Pune has a comparably benevolent weather as compared to Delhi. Summers are sweeter and so are winters. People of the city are great. They are quite helpful and humble. The city’s older areas have stark resemblance to Old Delhi and has lots of nice Forts, Temples, Museums and best of all eateries. Language is not a major issue as Marathi is somewhat similar to Hindi and most people understand Hindi but prefer to talk in Marathi. <em>Changla !</em></p>

<p>I am writing is post mostly in a log format and will keep adding information as an when I get more.</p>

<p>If google sent you here, then probably you too are interested/moving to Pune soon.I hope you find the information useful. The post is divided into several important sections that will be updated from time to time. Lots of unorganized info to follow so lets get started:</p>

<p><strong>Shelter</strong></p>

<p><em>This section deals with housing related things</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>If you are coming here for an IT company, most of them are concentrated in <em>Hinjewadi and Wakad</em> side of Pune, which geographically comes under Pimpri Chinchwad city of Pune Metropolitan Region. Then most popular housing locations will be Wakad, Hinjewadi, Vishal Nagar(Jagtap Dairy), Pimple Saudagar and Pimple Gurav.</li>
  <li>Before you hit the land, searching for houses/flats , take note of the relocation policy of your company and make sure brokerage is covered.</li>
  <li>Choose room-mates wisely. Initial judgements can be pretentious. You would certainly like to live with people on the same frequency as your’ s else, things could go wary.</li>
  <li>Prefer searching online on sites like <a href="http://housing.com/">Housing.com</a>, <a href="http://www.magicbricks.com">MagicBricks</a> etc first and prefer ones that are listed by Owners themselves to avoid steep brokerage , which is usually 1 month rent for 11 months agreement and 2 months rent for more than 11 months.</li>
  <li>Most societies have a board <em>Beware of Dogs</em> right below a board that says <strong>Bachelors Not Allowed</strong> that pretty much sets their priorities straight. Dont go looking for flats in them.</li>
  <li>Prefer on <em>pakka</em> agreement which requires you to go to the municipality office against a Notary Agreement. This depends on the landlord entirely. A pakka agreement is useful when you wish to own a vehicle in Pune where a notorized one bites the dust.</li>
  <li>In case you need furniture, the market has a rental based system. You can buy cheap and flimsy furniture and once you leave you can return it for 50-60% its value. Mattresses are also available for cheap.</li>
  <li>Some flats come with a furnished status but are usually 10k more than normal. If you plan to stay about 11 months then evaluate the economics. 10k* 11 = 1,11,000 INR. So, if the facilities are worth that even after depreciation. Go for it! else negotiate.</li>
  <li>Chalk out a <em>Room Mate Agreement</em> like Sheldon ! It helps in long run.</li>
  <li>D Mart is the best place to shop here.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Transportation</strong></p>

<p><em>This section deals with Transportation related things</em></p>

<h2 id="expect-nothing">Expect Nothing</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The city’s transport is abysmal and has been so since ages. The Pune City is a bit better but PCMC is worse. Its like Noida of Pune. Auto walla’s make money on your sufferings.Prefer Ola Cabs !</li>
  <li>You wont get a direct bus quite often. That was pretty irritating initially until i met Mr. Chaturvedi on the Rakshak Chowk Bus Stop one day. He his golden words were:  “Only a few buses go to your destination directly, but many go that way !” Saying so he boarded his bus to Vishrantwadi leaving me with ideas ! So, the trick is use <strong>Here Transit</strong> to find buses that go in the direction you want and board them and deboard at the point they divert from your path and then reboard. So, if you want to go to FC Road. Take a bus for PMC/Station and use the above algo.</li>
  <li>Get a 2 wheeler (I don’t have one though) ! OLX is great place to find or go to Rasta Peth for second hand stuff. Again you have to pay more to the brokers here, and a notorized agreement wont work !</li>
  <li>There is also a local train service in Pune but is not preferred unless you wish to travel out of the city like going to <em>Lonavala</em> or <em>Malavali</em> etc.</li>
  <li>If you wish to go to Mumbai ! Trust only <strong>Shivneri</strong> , Neeta has a terrible service everywhere and even to Ahemadabad (Been there Done that). You can also take shared cabs from Chinchwad Station. They charge about 200 - 250 bucks based on demand.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Food</strong></p>

<p><em>This section deals with Food related things</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>Everything is awesome! There are lot of options here. Dosa’s and Vada Pao’s are like staple street foods. The Standard Price for Vada Pao is 10 bucks and Dosa is 20- 30 bucks .</li>
  <li>There are lot of good places in the city. Try GoodLuck Cafe’s Fruit Fanny,La Plaisir Patisserie &amp; Bistro’s Chesse Cake, Garden Vada Pao , Marz-o-rin’s Sandwiches, Durvankur’s Thali or Sabutdana Wadi at Shaniwar Wada. Check Zomato for more listings. There is a <em>Burger King</em> as well in Koregaon Park where you get <em>gross</em> burgers and the infamous <em>German Bakery</em> is there too, near Osho Ashram</li>
  <li>You can’t get on eating from these restaurants on daily basis so, for usual days you can either hire a cook. There is no dearth of them and they charge around 600-700 per head.</li>
  <li>If cook is too much of a pain, go get a dabbawalla . He serves hot food in a tiffin at a reasonable price. Do ping me in the comments if you need any contacts. I have tried about 4 of them :P</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Internet</strong></p>

<p><em>This section deals with Connectivity related things</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>Internet Broadband service is a booming business here and there are tons and tons of them. To name a few Spectranet, iConnect, Reliance, Tikona, Tata Docomo, Airtel etc.</li>
  <li>Tikona is Ok and there are several breakdowns, but customer service is good.</li>
  <li>Docomo is great but limited to certain societies only.</li>
  <li>Reliance s*#ks as usual ! No support and useless Helplines, but its the cheapest.</li>
  <li>iConnect and Sprectranet are good too but again limited to some societies.</li>
  <li>As far as cellular connectivity is concerned. Voda&gt;Idea&gt;Airtel&gt;Docomo</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>POIs</strong></p>

<p><em>This section deals with Places to roam around</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>Shaniwar Wada</li>
  <li>Dagdu Shet Ganpati Temple</li>
  <li>Raja Dinakar Museum</li>
  <li>Lonavala</li>
  <li>Karla Caves , Malavali</li>
  <li>Sinhagad Fort</li>
  <li>Bike ride through Pashan Area</li>
  <li><em>will add more as i visit</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Hope people find this useful!</p>

<p>Cheers !!</p>

<p>Rohit</p>

        Kindify- Making PDFs readable on the Kindle
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">05 Apr 2015</span>

    <p>Probably <strong>YOU</strong> too bought the kindle to read those pdfs that you having been stashing in your hard drive and wondering when you will get to read them. <strong>YOU</strong> too considered it would be fantastic to read them, a single device for only books. Consider this no calumny to the device. But PDFs are seriously not its cup of tea. Mercurial, <strong>YOU</strong> might be seeing the way the PDF is rendered on the crisp screen. All those toggling and finger gymnastics to get to the line. Dah! I too didn’t seem comfortable.</p>

<p>Next came the fever of converting them to funny formats like .mobi etc that made a nicely indented book look like a unorganised vomit of words.</p>

<p>I tried assiduously to somehow read and lost interest until I stumbled upon a slick python library <em>pyPDF</em> while solving a problem with printing PDFs.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Clip the borders and Light you shall see !</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Kindle does automatically clip borders but it retains the primordial page number which limits the usability and since, it also indexes the page number anyway, even if I remove it using some python script it wont hurt.</p>

<p>So, This is what kindify does. Its a command line python utility that simply takes the pdf you intent to read and returns a PDF with the same name but -kindified appended to its file name to be read on the Kindle.</p>

<p>The only dependency is <em>pyPDF</em> .</p>

<p>Install PyPDF using pip :
<code class="highlighter-rouge">pip install pypdf</code></p>

<p>Now clone the github repository:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">git clone https://github.com/IndianTinker/kindify.git</code></p>

<p>Now, paste the PDF in the kindify directory and run the command:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">python kindify.py yourPdfName.pdf</code></p>

<p>An interactive menu will pop up with list of some famous book houses that have predefined cropping parameters. You can always choose the custom one to suit your needs or edit the predefined ones to suit your needs.</p>

<p>Lets see the magic in this sample from Orielly.
Before the script the PDF renders as follows:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/16834820407" title="Pre Script by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8752/16834820407_9c9be5a74e_z.jpg" width="385" height="640" alt="Pre Script" /></a></p>

<p>And after the script</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/16854436058" title="Post Script by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7620/16854436058_2968e35402_z.jpg" width="423" height="640" alt="Post Script" /></a></p>

<p>There is a difference between the two images. Clearly the second one is a <em>bit</em> more clear.
So, yet again Python saves the day!</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>

<p>Rohit</p>
