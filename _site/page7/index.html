        Day and Night
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">01 May 2018</span>

    <blockquote>
  <p>Day and Night presents a unique holographic experience of observing the day of an owl. The users can interact with the holographic owl using a constructed device. The device morphs the feeling of the owl into an earth like object. As the users touch the owl’s fur the owl playfully reacts to this sensation. On moving the globe, the time changes and it is day or night. Through this installation, we wished to draw attention to the changing circadian rhythms and the perceived control one has on it. Owl is a bird that wakes up in the night. Technology seems to have enabled us to become like owls.
This installation was presented at National Gallery of Modern Art, Mumbai, was a part of the <a href="http://www.dsource.in/events/naturembedded/">“Nature Embedded”</a> exhibition. The exhibition was inaugurated and visited by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paola_Antonelli">Paola Antonelli</a> .</p>

<h4>The exhibit at the gallery </h4>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/OHEAk7V.png" alt="People" /></p>

<h4>Concept</h4>

<p>We live seem to be living in a time when the day and night are mixing. No wonder a whole period of 24 hours is called a day. Technology has enabled us to live the day past the day. This situation has altered the circadian rhythm or the biological clock of the nature. We wanted to draw the attention of visitors, especially the kids, to this fact. That is why we chose Owls. Owls have an inverse circadian rhythm, they are up in night and sleep in the day. The metaphor of an owl draws attention and serves as a nice exploration of the chosen concept.</p>

<p>We wanted to retain the mysterious and hidden nature of an owl and tried the medium of a hologram to show the owls. Through the hologram, we bring the owl from the jungle to the museum. They can be seen from all sides.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/knGm54b.png" alt="Concept" /></p>

<p>The story does not end here, we wanted the visitors to interact with the owls. The setting allows us to playfully answer questions like , “How does an owl feel?”, “What will it do when we touch it?”, “Can we touch it?” . Through this we wished to break the boundary and connect the man back to nature. This could be considered as a means to develop empathy towards the bird and our condition like the bird. The owl was to animated and interactive and controlled by an owl like object.</p>

<h4>Production</h4>

<p>The team led by Vajra explored many options for the owl. We made these playful owls and modelled them.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/91NQDM5.png" alt="Owl-1" /></p>

<p>The models were used in Unity to design animations for owl’s reactions to touches and changing day and night.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/iOqCe3C.png" alt="Owl-2" /></p>

<p>After some projection headaches, we were able to produce consistent animated holograms :)
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/yKhrb6Q.png" alt="Holo" /></p>

<h4>Designing Interactions</h4>

<p>We used body storming to come up with possible ideas for interactions. The initial idea of a globe was not very semantic towards modelling a control focussed towards the owl. But the spherical shape was relevant as it showed time and earth. So, we designed a controller that had the tangible feel of an owl and offered the possibility to interact (not control) the owl by touching the fur on the sphere and change the environment of the owl by rotating the sphere.</p>

<p>So, the physical endpoints were touch and rotation. I started by prototyping a system with a ball and some touch sensors. As an electrical engineer, I love slip rings. So, we solved the problems of a moving contact touch sensor using a slip ring. The springs kept the ball in place and helped control the stiffness of the motion.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/JxPVlUX.jpg" alt="Prototyping-1" /></p>

<p>The final version had modality to touch parts of a sphere that triggered various responses in the hologram. Touching on right caused the owl to move towards right side and scratch. Touching both sides made the owl feel loved. Tapping on the ball made the owl happy and several other emotions were mapped to the touches on ball.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/8EZnFqX.jpg" alt="Circuit" /></p>

<p>On rotating the ball covered with fur, the user can change the time of the day. Make it day and night. This was sensed using an IR sensor. A technique I learned while designing speed sensors for <a href="/2014/04/01/Solaris/">my solar car project</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/SCYV8k7.png" alt="GlobeSense" /></p>

<p>The final controller looked like an inverted fur mouse (like in the 90s)</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/8p7B8Pd.png" alt="Final Globe" /></p>

<p>The final setup was placed in a dark place and users would often be amazed to find floating owls in the gallery.

<h4 id="team">Team</h4>

<p>The project was a part of my work done under Prof. Ravi and Prof. Ajanta at IDC. The super talented team at dsource and ekalpa project made the project possible. They include Vajra, Pranisha, Herold, Ravi, Malay, Deep, Shyam, Rajarshi, Swati, Vinaya, RamP (Audio) and other folks whose name I intermittently forgot.</p>

        Repurposing mass market addressable LEDs
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">04 Apr 2018</span>

    <blockquote>
  <p>This post describes an hack that allows one to re-purpose commonly available “fighter LED strips” to work with standard Neopixel firmwares. Also, this is my first post written in VIM \m/ . I have been having a good time using it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Recently, I was working on a design project that required me to produce illumination in different parts of a stair step and across different stairs. The obvious answer would be to use the WS2811/2812 LED strips. But, they can be very expensive and especially very difficult to procure in bulk quantities in India. The design was capped on the cost. The budget for LEDs was max 1000. I liked the idea, it satisfied the brief but only the cost variable was pushing it down.</p>

<p>It all changed on a recent trip to Pune. Pune has this power you see. I was half asleep in the bus when it stopped at the chikki corner in Lonanvala. Glancing outside with trivial expectations, I saw a “bhel corner” with Nyan cat type LEDs. I thought I was partially dreaming. I went outside and enquired. It was for real. The whole place was lit up with addressable LEDs. I looked around for signs of prosperity. None.</p>

<p>On enquiring, he says these strips cost him 850 rupees. They are available everywhere. Sceptically, I thought it might as well be available in Mumbai. The conversation ended with an extended Thank You and I was back to sleep, but planning my next trip to the worst electronics market i.e. Lamington . If its that cheap, there is tons of stuff that could be done, that was earlier rejected (like pixel walls)  due to budget constraints. These thoughts kept racing.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Next paragraph might seem to be a rant. Skip if you wish.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I visited Lamington post 5pm today. But yeah, I hate Lamington. Rational arguments? I am from Delhi (partially Pune). Delhi has Lajpat Rai Market. You can get tons of stuff there. Shopkeepers are there to make money. Do dhanda. Even if its Mehta, he will sell you stuff. But in Mumbai, they just shoo you away. I had to convince, Vega to give me a soldering iron bit that I saw in his poster. Thats the thing I am talking about. Let alone going inside, rummaging and getting things for you. I usually prefer ebay over lamington. LR–ebay–Abort(if unnecessary)–Lamington. The market in Delhi is very well packed together and addressable. Shops have numbers and everybody knows stuff. In Mumbai, Lamington is a hybrid Nehru Place, Wazirpur, and LR. The most useful part is just one row with switch point. Vega and Gala are Mehta’s of this place.The electronics market is also quite scattered. Another important point is the lack of cross referencing. In Delhi, usually, if someone does not have anything, he will guide you to another shop. Even if you ask a random shop to help you with the list, he would help you. Here its toooo competitive. X will not tell you the name of Y. He will straight away ignore this request like a bot. “ I don’t know” . There has been instances, where I got stuff just in the adjacent shop. So, its a dead end. Reload. This hampers the generation of a map of a market i usually use to plan my trips. For example, initially, It used to take me about 3-4 hours to get stuff in LR. Now, I hardly takes me an hour. Yes, I visit LR every time I am in Delhi.</p>

<p>So, I got the soldering bit and went on to search for the addressable LEDs. No one is ready to understand what I am saying. I even drew a picture of it. After spending about 2 hours. I laid my guns and started back for the station. I noticed near the station an audio equipment vendor has the exact same LEDs. I, kind of, beg him to tell me where he got them. I was pointed to go to Lohar Chawl, Kalbhadevi. He advised me to take a cab to a lane there they sell light fittings. A few stores there have these LEDs. These LEDs are difficult to find here in Lamington. Bingo, I took a cab and wondered about Kalbhadevi and Chawri Bazaar. Mumbai wins here. Kalbhadevi is like a paradise. It has anything you need. Mechanical shops, good vendors and helpful people. I reached Lohar Chawl, moved around a few shops, no luck here. One final shop, I thought. I drew again and explained him what I want. He said, <em>“Oh! You need a fighter LED strip?”</em> . I said, Ok? Let me see. He showed me and my eyes were wet and I bought it irrationally without bargaining the price. The thing costed me 650 for 5m. I later found a vendor who sold it to me for 450 too. Both were identical. So, <strong>fighter LED</strong> is the street name for addressable LEDs.</p>

<p>The default roll looked like this :</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h5TnJSPjE-A" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>It has a WS2811 chip that drives 3 RGB 5050 LEDs per segment. 
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/121xV90.jpg" alt="Imgur" /></p>

<p>The strip is powered by a 3A, 12V adapter. 
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/k41Rjgg.jpg?1" alt="Imgur" />
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/IkkiIpH.jpg" alt="Imgur" /></p>

<p>The controller is built on the strip. This is the coolest part.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/lJBTUWH.jpg" alt="Imgur" /></p>

<p>The name etching on the controller chip was sanded off, as expected. There was a 5V Zener to regulate power to the uC with a generous capacitor. 
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/33AqQ71.jpg?1" alt="Imgur" /></p>

<p>I removed 4 segments of 3 LEDs each from the end of the strip and soldered a DC jack to it.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/OybKC3G.jpg" alt="Imgur" /></p>

<p>I used the Tah board to give the strip a try. Did the usual stuff, Neopixellibrary and using 4 as LED number instead of 12 is the key here.
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/hJ5Dsnp.jpg" alt="Imgur" />
You essentially have 4 segments. The defaults worked. The only issue is the Blue and Green commands are reversed. So, whenever the Blue command was initiated from the Arduino in Tah Avatar, the green leds were lit. 
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/eOczHqg.jpg" alt="Imgur" />
That is a minor issue. But the best part is I have an addressable LED strip that I can program for cheap and most importantly, available in bulk.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4fw5S28d51I?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>Do let me know if this was useful. I am building stuff using these LEDs now. Ok, Bye!</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>

<p>Rohit</p>

        FAND - shareable haptic foot interface device
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">03 Dec 2017</span>

    <blockquote>
  <p>The project research was presented at IEEE SeGAH 2018, Vienna in a paper published as <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8401321"> Gupta,R. &amp; Dalvi, G (2018, May). FAND: A shareable haptic foot interface device. </a> .</p>
</blockquote>

<p>FAND (Foot associated neural device) is a haptic interface device that allows users to operate a computer (or certain applications) using all four limbs. The device uses user trained motion gestures that are bound to actions on a compatible application. One may be surprised to know that foot is only 10% less accurate than the hand. The interaction model developed in the project divides a task in a primary action and a secondary action. The primary, high priority and accurate task is handled by the hand, while the secondary tasks are handled by the foot. Devices like these are useful in times when most of our interaction are performed by the hands. This has increased the physiological load on hands. The possible applications are in applications like creative apps, Walking in Place (WIP) interactions in VR, and gaming. I evaluated the device by comparing it with a novel hand interaction device. In the study it was found that the foot device offers comparable learning and may be considered as a possible modality.</p>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/v5pzbJk.png" alt="Imgur" /></p>

<p>Several explorations and ideation were done in light of previous works and user studies conducted. The final report is be available <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CH4XgkzvzWaVjZDxJgtrWlma4ZTeb1hH/view?usp=sharing">here</a>. This report was made in Google Docs. ProTip: Do not use google docs of large documents. I never use google docs for more than 10 pages.</p>

<p>The post only covers some parts of a rather long design process (~ 6 months). I tried several techniques to understand the design of gesture systems. I did a <a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/wobbrock/">Wobbrock</a> style study to derive the guess-ability of certain guestures. The users were should de-contextualized prompts to certain interactions and were asked to come up with responses. I would encourage reading the paper by Wobbrock et al.</p>

<p>The prompts were like the below for zoom:

<p>Based on my <strong>user set</strong> the gesture set was as follows. One can obviously spot the similarities between these interactions and interactions performed by hands. Many users agreed that they performed the most natural interactions they could think of.

<p>The gesture set was used with the following <em>design requirements</em> to come up with several concepts.

<p>The most dominant concept was of a shareable foot accessory that was prototyped. The process of prototyping was done separately for both form and function.</p>

<p>Functional Prototype made using Arduino running thresholding and a simple wave pattern recognizer algorithm on the data of a MPU6050 gyro sensor</p>

<p>The prototype was tested with users using a true experiment design. The results showed that F(4,20) at p&lt;0.05 the device when compared to a new type of hand device like trackpoint has statistical significance (repeated measures ANOVA).Hence, both devices have similar learnability.</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>
