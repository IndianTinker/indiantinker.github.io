        Contributing to OSM using JOSM
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">31 Aug 2017</span>

    <blockquote>
  <p>This post is meant to document to process of uploading data points gathered as a part of <a href="https://info-design-lab.github.io/">Interactive Data Viz</a> course at IDC taught by Prof. Venkat.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="goal">Goal</h2>
<p>The aim of the exercise was to experience the process of collecting, analyzing and contributing data points to <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org">openstreetmaps</a>. This would allow the class to cperform a <strong>data mash-up</strong>. A data mash-up happens when a lot of data on various things is presented on a common -graphical- medium like maps. Data mash-ups can help us draw insights and suggest causality for certain occurrences. Through our experience, we learned that the density of data for a mash-up should be very high to draw interesting inferences.</p>

<h2 id="data-collection">Data Collection</h2>

<p>There are several ways to collect data:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Manual method</strong> : It involves taking a printout of your area under exploration using <a href="http://fieldpapers.org/">Field papers</a> and then once in the field, one marks places on the map. These positions are then manually plotted on the OSM map using their online editors or JOSM. The drawback of this methods is the accuracy. Since, the marking is relative, missile accuracy is often difficult to achieve. The advantage is that it allows more freedom and can work without phones. Hence, if a mapathon is organized then it would be better to use such a method that reduces the dependency on phones. There could be a specific group of people who would collect these sheets and mark these points on OSM later. Thanks for the tip, <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/about/team/rasagy-sharma/">Rasagy</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Apps</strong> : There are several Apps for <em>Android</em>. The goal is to essentially get a KML file. Most people used <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.m4b&amp;hl=en">Google MyMaps</a>. Other options are <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=np.com.softwel.swmaps&amp;hl=en">SWMaps</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mapswithme.maps.pro&amp;hl=en">Maps.me</a>. iPhone users can use the web version of Google MyMaps and plot the data manually on it. It gets stored in gDrive. Then export the kml out of gDrive. This method was followed by Shilpa. If anyone knows of a better way, please be sure to suggest.</li>
</ul>

<p>In conclusion, I think if the data is less (&lt; 20 points say) and precision is not required, then field paper method would be faster. This reduces the time wasted in converting formats. The data can then be replicated on the map using <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/ID">iD</a> or <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Potlatch_2">Potlatch2</a>(Flash alert!!). These editors are available online and many of my classmates with less number of points used them.</p>

<p>For a larger number of points we will proceed with JOSM method.</p>

<h2 id="post-data-collection">Post Data Collection</h2>

<p><strong>Preparing data</strong></p>

<p>Once you have your data points in KML or CSV or geoJson. You can proceed with the following process. It is advisable to have a geoJson file. It helps in running vizualization when using Mapbox. Helpful tools are :</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://mapbox.github.io/togeojson/">KML/GPX to geoJson</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://geojson.io">geoJson to CSV</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The process I followed was KML –&gt; CSV –&gt;geoJson</p>

<p><strong>Icons and OSM features</strong></p>

<p>Like Mapbox’s Maki icons, OSM also has its own set of icons. They can be rendered on the map when you choose specific tags. The list of tags are mentioned <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_Features">here</a>. The icons column on the page shows the icons that will be shown on the map. For example : I chose to map sitting places in IIT Campus. The most semantically suitable choice was of a bench. I used the ‘field’ as ‘amenity’ and value as ‘bench’. You can choose appropriately. The features can be added to the points using the CSV file. Once you have the CSV file you can add a new ‘column’ as amenity (in my case) using your favorite spreadsheet software. Now, in every ‘row’ i.e. for each data point add the value. This would be ‘bench’ in my case. You can have additional fields as well. It is preffered not to have spaces in between the words of the field. Use an ‘_’ .</p>

<p>Once this is done, you should have a dataset in csv we can proceed to map them on OSM. As an additional step, I also generate a geoJSON file.</p>

<p>Rasagy suggested some <em>pro-tips</em> like :</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tagging_for_the_renderer">Tagging for the renderer</a>: The point is to collect the data and not have icons marked on the map. As many features might not have icons for them, it is suggested to mark real data.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/One_feature,_one_OSM_element">One feature, one element</a> : This point should be considered when adding details to already existing features. Instead of adding a new node/point for some area, it is better to include that detail in the existing polygon itself.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:operator">Operator- Key</a>: Since, facilities in IIT will probably be run by IIT. It is worthwhile to include an <em>operator</em> key in the data. For example: The staff canteen could have an “operator: IIT Bombay” tag.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Some other tips i found <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Good_practice">here</a> that deserve a mention are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Armchair_mapping">Refrain from Armchair mapping</a></li>
  <li>Do not add temporary events on the OSM map. These could include things like Ganpati Pandals. One can use the <em>geojson on map</em> approach for this.</li>
  <li>Map for verifiability. Hence, mapping historical events on OSM is not a good practise.</li>
  <li>If you find that your data needs a new tag on OSM, then follow this <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/New_Features">new features</a> page .</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>OSM Contributing</strong></p>

<p>As a class, we tried several methods. The following method uses the <a href="https://josm.openstreetmap.de/">JOSM IDE</a> to import the data as a map layer and then contribute it to OSM database. <strong>Before proceeding</strong>, check multiple times that your data fields are correctly rendered. You can test this <a href="http://geojson.io">here</a>. Once you update, it <em>might</em> be cubersome to update/edit them .</p>

<p>First, Download the <a href="https://josm.openstreetmap.de/">IDE</a>  for the OS of your own choice.</p>

<p>I have documented it for windows that came <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wF_vKXrOtY8">bunduru</a>-ed with my machine.</p>

<p>Once, the software is installed, we need to install a plugin called <em>OpenData</em> this enables JOSM to read csv files. Press F12 or Edit -&gt; Pref and choose plugins and type opendata. You may want to do Download list before. Then check the box and click OK. This installs OpenData plugin.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/36952326825/in/album-72157686030264413/" title="opendata"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4410/36952326825_4062955f0f_z.jpg" width="640" height="621" alt="opendata" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Now we need a map layer to work on. The preffered way is to use ‘open location’ option from ‘File’ menu option. You are presented with the following dialog.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/36812725461/in/album-72157686030264413/" title="FileDownload"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4367/36812725461_07f1def4bb_z.jpg" width="590" height="298" alt="FileDownload" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>In this dialog, paste the url of the map you wish JOSM to pull. In my case, it was this <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=15/19.1337/72.9126">http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=15/19.1337/72.9126</a>.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/36952326615/in/album-72157686030264413/" title="osm"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4404/36952326615_fcddd6a18f_z.jpg" width="640" height="341" alt="osm" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Once downloaded, I got this.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/36952326985/in/album-72157686030264413/" title="result"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4337/36952326985_bd8d70a0a7_z.jpg" width="640" height="337" alt="result" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>By the this point, we have a base layer ready. Now, I opened the csv file. The usual File –&gt; Open way .</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/36764737856/in/album-72157686030264413/" title="openfiles"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4382/36764737856_5857da0a1e_z.jpg" width="640" height="411" alt="openfiles" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>My file is ‘points.csv’.Click Open. In the popup while importing CSV. The default options worked.
The file gets rendered correctly over the base layer as points. In my case the color of points was cyan.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/36812725561/in/album-72157686030264413/" title="bench local"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4437/36812725561_7f6556a133_z.jpg" width="640" height="343" alt="bench local" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Please check the points before proceeding.</p>

<p><strong>Uploading to OSM</strong></p>

<p>Once checked, you may proceed by clicking on the upload icon. I got this warning popup. I clicked continue as I had checked the data multiple times.
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/36764737376/in/album-72157686030264413/" title="warning"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4335/36764737376_53d00d84ca_z.jpg" width="640" height="290" alt="warning" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Next you get another warning. One of the fields had a space in between. I chose to ignore it as it was not a standard field anyway. But, I would strictly advice that you use only features mentioned in <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_Features">wiki</a>. One should never mark outside the wiki, this would make your contributions virtually indiscoverable as the standard parsers/scrapers/crawlers would only use standard tags. If none of the tags fit the feature, you should request that particular tag to be added to the wiki.”This prevents everyone from tagging similar kind of features in their own way before a standard is set, and therefore OSM discourages using tags outside of what is currently listed on the wiki”, adds Rasagy.</p>

<p>You need an OSM account to upload. The API uses OAuth. The method that worked for me is ‘Automatic’. You are likely to get OAuth credentials. JOSM stores them for you. After the authorization part, you are required to commit the changes.  You will be presented with the following dialog.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/36764737336/in/album-72157686030264413/" title="upload"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4346/36764737336_42cf629aa7_z.jpg" width="640" height="618" alt="upload" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I chose the data source as ‘survey’. Now, press ‘Upload’!</p>

<p>Congratulations on contributing to OSM.</p>

<p>You can reopen the location to see your data. In my case, my benches are on the map.
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/36814389321/in/dateposted-public/" title="markedbench"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4343/36814389321_6c90e0ab13_z.jpg" width="640" height="341" alt="markedbench" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>You can pull the details by clicking on ‘History’ button.
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/36812725511/in/dateposted-public/" title="contributorInfo"><img src="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4364/36812725511_a9ee731fe2_z.jpg" width="640" height="362" alt="contributorInfo" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I hope this guide will be helpful.</p>

        Paisa Stick- A tangible cashless payment interface
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">03 Aug 2017</span>

    <blockquote>
  <p>This project was done during Masters at IDC. The project was selected as winner in student design category at CHI 2017 in Denver, Colorado. The paper on the same has been included in conference proceedings and can be read <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3049268">here</a>. The team members were <a href="https://www.behance.net/udayanvidyanta">Udayan</a> and  <a href="https://www.behance.net/silpa_murali">Silpa</a>.</p>

<p>Paisa stick is a tangible payment interface designed to perform cashless transactions. We designed it by understanding the conceptual model of senior members in the society. The device works as a remote and transfers value from one device to many other different types of devices like phones, IVRs, and android apps. User is always informed about the money he has and he can simply press the buttons to generate any required currency value. The device is not connected to internet and has actual value stored in the device. It can be recharged like a phone.</p>

<p>In our field studies, the users described how they think about money. The metaphor of a wallet as a store of lower value was very dominant. They faced difficulties in using popular mediums like BHIM, PayTM, and even ATMs. However, the idea of telephone recharges was something they liked. So, we designed and prototyped a device that allows them perform cashless transactions while with the comfort and security of a wallet.</p>

<h5>Let us explore backwards..</h5>

<p>The competition brief can be read <a href="https://chi2017.acm.org/designcompetition.html">here</a>. In the light of this brief, we chose to work on <em>how might we help the elderly and digitally illiterate perform cashless transactions</em>. The recent events of demonetization helped in setting up the premise for such a solution. Our main contribution was conducting several studies to try and understand the conceptual model elderly have towards performing such transactions.</p>

<p>The design process is covered in this short video below :</p>

        The CHI 17 Experience
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">12 Jun 2017</span>

    <p>I am just back from one of the most amazing conferences ever. Most of you might know but just to re-iterate, I was fortunate enough to be selected as a student volunteer at CHI 2017 conference in Denver, Colorado. Later we also made to the top 12 teams who were invited to present their work in the Student Design Competition. CHI stands for Computer-Human Interaction and is one of the oldest gatherings of Interaction Community in the world.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This post broadly describes the experience at the conference. Keep checking for more touristy and observation posts. I am happy to inform that a major part of the conference will be sponsored by <a href="http://www.sigchi.org/conferences/funding/gary-marsden-student-development-fund">Gary Marsden Student development fund</a>.  I and my team members- Shilpa and Udayan are grateful to the committee members for considering us for the same.</p>

<p>We landed in Denver on 6th May late night. It was a long journey from Mumbai-New Delhi-London-New York- Denver. It was just in time to attend the SV briefing next day. The conference venue was the Colorado Convention Center, guarded by a giant Blue Bear.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/35478177275/in/album-72157682238049102/" title="Giant Blue Bear"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4254/35478177275_c63f4c8058_z.jpg" width="640" height="360" alt="Giant Blue Bear" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>It was about 20min (of slow, exploratory) walk from our Hotel - 11th Avenue. The venue was fantastic and a mid-aged man would always greet you when you walked in like you were the chief guest. But he did that to everyone it seems.</p>

<p>As a volunteer, I had to put in 20 hours in return for awesomeness. In the briefing, Anna and Patrick, the chairs, explained us the gravity and breadth of our work. An important line that kind of sticks was “ SVs are the interface of the conference”. The kind of efforts the chairs put in is commendable. They reply to each and every query any SVs have. Many SVs were not Locals and hence communication is the key to establishing confidence in such cases. After the briefing, a tour of the venue was given and we had to collect our IDs and Tshirts - Orange ones.</p>

<p>Our competition was in the later half of the conference and I spent most of the time doing my SV tasks and attending sessions. The opening plenary was by Prof. Neri Oxman from Media Labs. It was an excellent session in which she presented her work. I was in charge of collecting the audience questions and presenting them for sorting. Neri’s work on reflecting how nature and modern technology can be used to express is amazing. I loved her presentation on the bee project and later the silkworm project. Her work the furthers the limits of modern fabrication is intriguing. She also gave us a sneak peek into some latest projects. Her talk was titled- “Material Ecology”</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/34581518644/in/album-72157682238049102/" title="Neri Oxman"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4282/34581518644_9afe5ed6e0_z.jpg" width="640" height="481" alt="Neri Oxman" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Over the course of the conference, I was allotted tasks like attending and managing paper sessions, courses, talks and galleries. I was able to attend many paper presentations that I had initially planned. Another great part about being an SV is that you get to attend SV Rockstar Lunches. There we meet industry experts and stars who interact openly with fellow SVs. I had the honour to meet Prof. Hiroshi and Prof. Pattie during these sessions.It was a great experience to talk to them.</p>

<p>Just in case, these are the tasks that were allocated.</p>

<p>I would like to mention that the volunteers were served exceptional food during the conference. The inclusiveness of the menu is worth appreciating as it had plenty for almost all dietary inclinations. It was great having vegetarian food. I am told that this aspect of the volunteering is often envied by other participants.</p>

<p>CHI made it possible for remote attendees to have a first person experience of the conference using these telepresence robots called Beam. It was intriguing to see people with faces on the screen moving around and other people hugging them. Some Beams had personalizations that the original attendees had done. I personally liked one with the Tutu.</p>

<p>There were some great installations presented by participants in the Art Gallery too. It was interesting to see how art, design and technology were amalgamated in an artifact that presents a view point. Some were playful like the talking plants and some question the ways and represent it like the installation that would tear any racist tweet tweeted on the Internet.</p>

<p>There was also a gigantic structure made out of used plastic bottles with 3D printed joinery.</p>

<p>CHI provides a great place to meet people from varied and similar backgrounds, that deepens and expands your perspective.</p>

<p>Now, to the main event, The Student Design Competition.</p>

<p>The theme this year was leveling the playing field. We chose the problem of adoption of modern payment methods like m-wallets and Credit cards in elderly and digitally illiterate users.Our entry to the competition was Paisa Stick. Paisa stick is a tangible interface that allows digitally illiterate users to operate cashless systems. We studied the conceptual model of money in the user group and made a small device called ‘Paisa stick’.The device is a tangible representation of an actual wallet and operates following the concepts familiar to the users. More on this can be read in the paper <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3049268">here</a>.</p>

<p>This was, in fact, the second round of the competition. The first round required us the submit a research paper and a video explaining the concept. We got great feedback at this stage from anonymous reviewers which helped us improve the project. Our entry was selected from 70 entries who submitted their work. Out of which 12 were called to visit Denver.</p>

<p>The day of the poster presentation came. We were working all night trying to concretize our poster presentation and practice the presentation.</p>

<p>We made Mr.Roy, our stick puppet who we used to explain the concept to the judges.</p>

<p>We were very anxious and nervous. Such amazing projects around us from students around the globe. We explained our project, showed the process and prototype that we developed. The feedback was great. We were shortlisted for the final round of three which would happen next day.</p>

<p>More nervousness followed. We worked tirelessly on the presentation. We knew that we would have to explain the context in great detail for the audience to understand the solution. And we were going first!</p>

<p>The presentation went great. All the team presented their ideas in great depth and all were amazing.</p>

<p>I am delighted to inform that we were selected as the winners for this year’s CHI SDC.</p>

<p>Thanks to Sir Peto a.k.a. Prof. Mario Moreno from Universidad Tecnológica De La Mixteca who encouraged and supported us throughout the conference. Special thanks to Prof. Anirudha and Prof. Girish Dalvi for the guidance and support in writing the paper. Super thanks to our seniors specifically Chandni, Chinmay and Shreya who presented at CHI last year and helped us throughout.</p>

<p>After the competition, my SV duties resumed. I was still quite behind my 20-hour target, but thanks to the allotment on the last day, I was able to put in the hours. The final task was to tear-down the exhibition area. We disassembled the giant plastic structure.</p>

<p>The closing plenary was by the celebrated author, Nicholas Carr. He talked about automation and its impact on the sensitivities of human life. It was titled “Computers, Automation and the Human Future”. The talk was interesting as it rekindled the dilemmas of involving computers to induce automation in tasks that were responsible for developing human sensitivities and skills. I think Nicholas was able to put the point in a very open way. The talk provided an interesting perspective to the HCI community and was a great way to end the conference. This was followed by handing over the baton to the CHI 2018 committee. I loved the overall enthusiasm of the moment.</p>

<p>In the spirit of the brevity of this post, I would like to end by saying that I had a fabulous time at CHI as a volunteer and as a participant. It helped me a lot in understanding the work happening in the domain.</p>

<p>I will certainly try attending CHI whenever it is possible. If anyone has any queries please feel free to contact me via the comments below or via Twitter handle @rohit7gupta.</p>

<p>ありがとう</p>
