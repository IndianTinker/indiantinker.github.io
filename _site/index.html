        How to accept alipay payments on your Nuxtjs app using Stripe and Deta

    <span class="post-date">21 Aug 2021</span>

    <blockquote>
  <p>This article talks about how to accept Alipay payments using Stripe. PS: I am not a front-end person. Heck, I don’t really know what is my discipline, but anyways, this is just a suggestive guide.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="context">Context</h3>

<p>One fine summer day, hanging out with my friend, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/creativemutation/">Aman</a> and playing with his Oculus, a problem surfaced. He is having troubles accepting payments from his chinese clients. Many of them use Alipay to pay, but unfortunately he is not able to accept that on his website.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>BTW, he runs a <a href="https://www.cademy.xyz/">cool school</a> that teaches people computational design and how to use it in product design realm. Do check him out. His school is <strong>post paid</strong> as it is aimed at students. Very interesting model.. he screens and talks to each student to account for purchase power parity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He uses <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a> on his Squarespace website and everything is no-code (yeah! cool people things.). The power of these tools is pretty baffling.</p>

<h3 id="problem">Problem</h3>

<p>Anyways, so, sipping some <em>tinto de verano</em> we had a problem that a Chinese student who has already attended one of his live classes needs to pay using Alipay. The conventional Stripe payment did not work. The customer care of Squarespace (that integrates Stripe) asked him to contact Stripe and Stripe’s documentation can be baffling sometimes. He was stuck 😔</p>

<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>

<p>So, over the last weekend, we worked together to implement a way to accept alipay payments using Stripe. It is not yet integrated into squarespace . For the test, We used the direct session link. #NotBuiltForScale</p>

<p><br />Hopefully, this write-up helps people integrate Alipay in their payment stacks and provides template code to do so. Surprisingly, this needs a simple server script that generates the payment session and hence, cannot be done entirely client-only. It beats me why, but as Old John says, this is what it is. 
<br /></p>

<p>For this example, I used <a href="https://nuxtjs.org/">Nuxtjs</a> (Like Next but for Vue 💚 ) with the <a href="https://vuestripe.com">vue-stripe</a> plugin. The Nuxt SPA calls a <a href="https://www.deta.sh">deta microservice endpoint</a> to generate a payment session on Stripe. The micro-service responds with sessionID generated. This session ID is used to redirect the customer to payment page. Our flow is based on the method described by stripe’s documentation <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/payments/alipay/accept-a-payment?platform=checkout">here</a>.</p>

<p>I will only be sharing the code for the ‘glue’ micro-service and sample vue page.</p>

<p>The schematic (drawn by yours truly) is as follows :
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/kEV5cLC.png" alt="alt" /></p>

<p>So, lets go step by step (<em>paso a paso</em>):</p>
<h5 id="step-1-">Step 1 :</h5>
<p>Nuxt and Axios are pretty common things as far as some front-end folks tell me. But to accept money, you need a payment partner. This payment partner will take our customer’s data to the payment handler (like VISA/ Mastercard) and make sure we get the money. Stripe is a service like that. <br /> Now to talk to stripe, from our webapp, I used a plugin called <a href="(https://vuestripe.com)">vue-stripe</a>. It is an official plugin for Vue/Nuxt and nicely documented. The plugin, helps package data and make calls in such a way that stripe standards are respected. If you are not doing something special (like us), the examples are just copy paste away from deploy. But…</p>
<h5 id="step-2-">Step 2 :</h5>
<p>In our case, we need to accept Alipay. Alipay (for reasons i do not know) cannot be accepted entirely using a client-only implementation. This took me a while to figure out. So, we need to write a server side script that takes in our data and generates a <a href="https://stripe.com/en-in/payments/payment-links">checkout session</a>. To do this, I used Deta.<br /> <a href="(https://www.deta.sh)">Deta</a> is a service that deploys and runs nodejs/python scripts on the cloud. It gives you an end-point to talk to. I have been playing with it for mostly useless things until now. <br /> Interestingly enough,  I have come to prefer it over netlify functions as :</p>
<ul>
  <li>Its entirely free</li>
  <li>the deploy speed is very fast</li>
  <li>The Toolchain is intuitive</li>
  <li>The <a href="https://twitter.com/detahq">team</a> is adorable.</li>
</ul>

<p>The function shown below takes in our POST request from Nuxt front-end and passes it to stripe’s servers. We have added alipay as a payment method to support in this particular session. Then, it returns a checkout session ID as a response. The session ID is consumed by the nuxt app as explained in Step 3.</p>

<p>Hope this helps someone on the internet. I <strong>must</strong> stress again, I am not a front-end developer, I just did this for fun. If anyone has any constructive criticism, I am open to learn :-)
<br />
With this hope,
Cheers y un abrazo, <br />

<h3 id="criminalization-of-slowness">Criminalization of slowness</h3>

<p>Many times and many things have to be done fast. No one asks <em>Why</em>? 
Fast food, Fast design (Design Thinking), Fast Code (Lean, Sprint, Agile) all lead to bad health, eventually.</p>

<p><br />
Details are lost. There is no fun. The society or the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/11/accelerationism-how-a-fringe-philosophy-predicted-the-future-we-live-in">accelerationist</a> environment of progress criminalizes for slowly done work. <a href="https://fs.blog/2021/05/slack/">Slack</a> is punished and tasks are automated. As you gain time for being fast, the joy one gets from the task is not there. The immersion is superficial and checklist-y. There is always a server or process to blame for the lack of fun. No wonder many fast jobs are no longer creative but are creativity served like Big Mc Burger.</p>

<p>Fast, IMO, is largely a marketed trait and not a natural, required one. Humans cannot be fast in everything, we are slow animals. Remember the last time you were expecting something to be fast. Was it at a home delivery ? Or was it running at the cost of not enjoying? Most of this ‘need for speed’ is actually not needed.</p>

<h3 id="need-for-speed-in-the-pandemic">Need for Speed in the pandemic</h3>

<p>As they say that the depth is in the details. Details seem to take more time to consume. The lowering attention span is already a pandemic fueled by the many attention kidnapping apps. Then there are all these things about reading 300 books a year, listening to 10x podcasts, and blah blah. You get that. The point is, being on the surface and consuming thing (podcasts, books, etc) does not leave time enough for that essential reflection to truly see the depth.</p>

<p>The pandemic seems to have increased this as well. As we all, lay trapped in a cabin, working and watching, there is a reinvention pressure. Binging to stay ahead of the Netflix buffet seems to be quite predominant. FYI, Netflix considers a <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/netflix-viewership-two-minutes/">viewing time for more than 2 minutes</a> as a view. Seldom do viewers pay attention to the way the shot has been composed and lately, the directors have lost ‘that’ cinematic attention (again IMO). Many friends watch shows for several seasons only to forget what they were about. They do give a good rating.</p>
<h3 id="slowness-and-learning">Slowness and Learning</h3>

<p>Many skills are best learned when we start slowly. Like slow, SLOW. As Dreyfus Model of Skills suggests, slowly copying without striving to post on instagram yet!🤭</p>

<p>Especially with sports, If one is training to run for a marathon, it is the ability to consistently run at slower speeds and save the boost for later. Murakami often recounts this in his book , <em>What I Talk About When I Talk About Running</em>. It does get very irritating as we begin. My runner friend, Ben, always suggests me to run for a longer time than for longer distances or lesser times. I guess it’s the same when you learning music. The tempo is slow, but that is required for muscle memory to build up.  <br />
John Cleese talks about it in the section of his book, <em>Creativity: A Short and Cheerful Guide</em> on “Tortoise brain” and “Hare Brain”. He largely attributes the Tortoise brain to unconscious processes and the Hare brain that gets things done. Hence, we need both and not just mindless running.<br />
So, I want to make a point that there seems to be value in not being fast all the time. Maybe a bit slow can help us all. Slow is not lazy. Fast is not all bad. A good mix of reflection, conscious consumption, and production seem to be the key. Like this beer commercial from Madrid, asking you to live without haste.

<br />
This article may seem like a rant or an observation. However, I am trying to make a case for slow. I have a simpler follow-up article on some habit or rituals, I have been experimenting with to cope with these experiences. I hope I can edit that soon and put it out.</p>

<p><br />
Until then, chill. 🐢 🍻</p>

Cheers y un abrazo, <br />

    <p><i>The funeral pyre,</i></p>

<p><i>The heat of its fire.</i></p>

<p><i>The cries and tears</i></p>

<p><i>The memories and bonds</i></p>

<p><i>Are all broken now. </i>
<br />
 <i>Sorry! I could not see you.</i></p>

<p><i>He cried,</i></p>

<p><i>Sorry! I left you alone</i></p>

<p><i>He wept.</i></p>

<p><i>Sorry! I was not there</i></p>

<p><i>He wrote.</i>
<br />
 <i>As smoke carried his grandpa</i></p>

<p><i> He stood there.</i></p>

<p><i>The smoke is what were are</i></p>

<p><i>he once said</i></p>

<p><i>and smoke is what he became </i></p>

<p><i>in the end. </i></p>
