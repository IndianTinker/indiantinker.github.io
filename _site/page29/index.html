        Kindify- Making PDFs readable on the Kindle
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">05 Apr 2015</span>

    <p>Probably <strong>YOU</strong> too bought the kindle to read those pdfs that you having been stashing in your hard drive and wondering when you will get to read them. <strong>YOU</strong> too considered it would be fantastic to read them, a single device for only books. Consider this no calumny to the device. But PDFs are seriously not its cup of tea. Mercurial, <strong>YOU</strong> might be seeing the way the PDF is rendered on the crisp screen. All those toggling and finger gymnastics to get to the line. Dah! I too didn’t seem comfortable.</p>

<p>Next came the fever of converting them to funny formats like .mobi etc that made a nicely indented book look like a unorganised vomit of words.</p>

<p>I tried assiduously to somehow read and lost interest until I stumbled upon a slick python library <em>pyPDF</em> while solving a problem with printing PDFs.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Clip the borders and Light you shall see !</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Kindle does automatically clip borders but it retains the primordial page number which limits the usability and since, it also indexes the page number anyway, even if I remove it using some python script it wont hurt.</p>

<p>So, This is what kindify does. Its a command line python utility that simply takes the pdf you intent to read and returns a PDF with the same name but -kindified appended to its file name to be read on the Kindle.</p>

<p>The only dependency is <em>pyPDF</em> .</p>

<p>Install PyPDF using pip :
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pip install pypdf</code></p>

<p>Now clone the github repository:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git clone https://github.com/IndianTinker/kindify.git</code></p>

<p>Now, paste the PDF in the kindify directory and run the command:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">python kindify.py yourPdfName.pdf</code></p>

<p>An interactive menu will pop up with list of some famous book houses that have predefined cropping parameters. You can always choose the custom one to suit your needs or edit the predefined ones to suit your needs.</p>

<p>Lets see the magic in this sample from Orielly.
Before the script the PDF renders as follows:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/16834820407" title="Pre Script by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8752/16834820407_9c9be5a74e_z.jpg" width="385" height="640" alt="Pre Script" /></a></p>

<p>And after the script</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/16854436058" title="Post Script by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7620/16854436058_2968e35402_z.jpg" width="423" height="640" alt="Post Script" /></a></p>

<p>There is a difference between the two images. Clearly the second one is a <em>bit</em> more clear.
So, yet again Python saves the day!</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>

<p>Rohit</p>

        Improving UX of FM/AM Audio
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">02 Apr 2015</span>

    <blockquote>
  <p>This post describes the work done during my time at Tata Motors Research Center in Pune. I worked as an Assistant Manager in Human Machine Interface department. Here, I present my work on defining strategies to improve FM/AM user experience and implementation of the same. The work was first used in Tata Tiago/Tigor.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Good Design is as Little Design as Possible” — D. Rams</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Context</h4>
<p>With a burst of highly “connected” media options available in cars, FM/AM or Radio still happens to be a widely used feature in infotainment units.  However, based on many field requests the experience of FM was not at par with other media options like USB/BT/SD and needed some rethinking. Further, there was a need to establish a more data-informed tuning process.</p>

<h4>Work</h4>
<p>The work started by understanding the entire signal reception flow from the antenna to the infotainment unit and the chip in infotainment. We explored to the level of the algorithms used in the RTOS to play channels. This helped us, as designers/engineers get a perspective on the scope of changes. We even studied the antenna cables and their routing. This helped us identify their vicinity with EM noise generating components like alternators and engine. Then we did a small exercise to find out possible conditions that might result in pain points. These were a sudden loss of reception (when entering an area with no coverage like a tunnel), reducing signal strength (when traveling outside the city), and system scanning for stations (auto store). We carried out several benchmarking sprints with our spectrum analyzer which gave us the ground truth. A comparison with other competitive cars was done. It was quite a hectic process. We had to often drive in places where there was not even a road and test reception. A customer can be anywhere, we should provide the best experience everywhere was the motivation.  A nice part was we could see some country and eat some local food. But we spent the whole day in hot weather in test cars.  After about 5-6 such exercises over a few months, we were able to suggest an FM algorithm that could be implemented. In the process, we figured out how to do spectrum analysis and find signal strength values. Then correlate it with readings of the infotainment, figure out leaks, and calibrate the system. <br /> The simulation exercises helped and we were able to detect conditions like tunnel entry, driving out of zone based on readings. We would dynamically adjust the volume curve/filters based on such events.</p>

<h4>Learnings</h4>
<p>The work was challenging and I read a lot on FM/AM. I learned to operate the spectrum analyzers as well. This sparked my interest in Audio based user experiences in a car environment. The whole exercise also taught me about the design of such a system. I was in a weird position in Tata Motors, I was doing the work of design to technology integration. I would know what users want and could understand what the engineering team was doing in the code. I had to work on aligning all these stakeholders together. BTW, I even made <a href="/2015/05/17/FM430/">my own FM receiver</a> that could show vague signal strength, when I was finding it hard to understand that spectrum analyzer. :)</p>

<h4>How it affected the company</h4>
<p>The same FM/AM reception component was used in several other platforms. It seems to have improved the shape FM/AM was in the car. The experience was pushed as a part of Tiago/Tigor and may even have been pushed to others.</p>

        Vehicle Acoustics Strategy

    <span class="post-date">01 Apr 2015</span>

    <blockquote>
  <p>This post describes the work done during my time at Tata Motors Research Center in Pune. I worked as an Assistant Manager in Human Machine Interface department.

<p><a href="https://www.deccanchronicle.com/business/autos/280317/6-things-you-may-not-know-about-tata-tiago.html">Deccan Chronicle</a> reporting about my work</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/KPXAg4o.png" alt="Cardekho" /></p>

<h3>How did it happen?</h3>
<h4>Context</h4>
<p>I was assigned to the HMI-PAT in ODT division team at Tata Motors RnD in Pune. If the reader is familiar with automotive industry org maps: TML follows a ford style one with some variation due to the acquisition of JLR. This was after Zest and Bolt had launched. The department knew that acoustics needs “quantitative standards” for improvement and benchmarking. We already have instruments to measure spectrum signal strength and audio quality.</p>
<h4>Work</h4>
<p>I studied various ways to capture and rate the quality of audio output in a contained environment. This also introduced me to the sound chamber. I did several studies using specialized audio workstations used in the audio recording industry. Then I reworked on the testing procedures an used in the audio equipment market. So, I read audio reports and worked on a pipeline to get this data from a car environment. The process was:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Get data (audio curves like spectrograms etc but with correlation to specific vehicle params) from the car. We used an ASIO compatible Audio Interface and 4 point microphones placed at audio centers of users in the car</li>
  <li>Normalize the data using the sound chamber in two cases (engine running and engine not running).</li>
  <li>Perform the tests on 5 competition cars</li>
  <li>Perform qualitative feedback tests on all 5 cars with users</li>
  <li>Correlate qualitative and quantitative data.</li>
  <li>Suggest improvements in audio curve (audio filter design PoV) and find dependent vehicle build parameters (speaker cavity size, speaker location, speaker size, speaker mounting style (3 bolt/4 bolt/press fit) or vibration absorption unit)</li>
  <li>The filter design was later tested and improved by audio experts once the baseline curve was approved.</li>
  <li>The dependent vehicle build parameters were suggested to design and cavity design teams for adoption in new cars (like Tiago/Tigor/Nexon/Harrier )</li>
</ul>

<h4>Learnings</h4>
<p>I learned a lot about org hierarchy and general social skills. On a design point, I was able to design a validated process to do such a kind of analysis for the system. I learned a lot about audio systems from a reproduction point of view. Further, I got acquainted with using ASIO based interfaces by the end of the assignment. I learned about features like SDVC (speed dependent volume control) and its underlying implementation.</p>

<h4>How it affected company </h4>
<p>The response of the activity was initially cold, but as we started working on details of correlation, we were shocked that our recommendations were adopted in the upcoming programs. A new category for audio analysis was added as a part of benchmarking activity. The detailed process is confidential and is published in the company as a “Work Guideline”.</p>

<h4>In Market</h4>
<p>The first vehicle to show this was Tiago. The audio system received a superb response. Especially the audio output which had some of Tata and HARMAN’s algorithmic magic. For a feature preferred segment, the audio system was “intelligently” designed to sound like a car from at-least mid-luxury segments. The sales of the car are one of the best in TML’s recent launches and continue to soar. My work may have affected the buying choice of about 6000 customers per month.</p>
