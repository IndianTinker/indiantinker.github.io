      <a href="/2014/04/16/Tiano-Piano/">
        Tiano- The Touchscreen Piano
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">16 Apr 2014</span>

    <p>Touchscreens..huh.. They are all around us..Phones ,tablets, phablets and now even laptops. Most of them have a capacitive touchscreen where the change in capacitance at a point is used to sense it and then perform the corresponding action. Capacitive ones are multi point sensing. They sense more than 2 points and hence we get those pinch to zoom features etc.</p>

<p>On the other hand , almost archaic version on touchscreen is the resistive version. That are pretty easy to interface with almost any microcontroller with an ADC. In this project i did over the weekend i tried to interface a touchscreen ( resistive one..) ,available at mobile repair shops in Delhi with a MSP430G2553 (Although MSP430G2231 would also do)  to make a piano.</p>

<p><a href="http://indiantinker.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/touchscreen-setup.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-339" alt="Touchscreen setup" src="http://indiantinker.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/touchscreen-setup.jpg" width="470" height="230" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Pre-requisites</strong>: The touchscreen may not be easier to get. I got mine from a mobile repair shop in LR. It is a 4-wire Touchscreen, pretty common with horribly thin contacts that took a lot of patience to solder.There is a lot of literature available on Touchscreens on the internet. I found two app notes that were best. First one from <a href="http://www.atmel.in/Images/doc8091.pdf" target="_blank">Atmel</a> , that explained the working of the touchsreen in a pretty clear way and one from <a href="http://www.ti.com/lit/an/slaa384a/slaa384a.pdf" target="_blank">TI</a> that some what helped in the software part.</p>

<p>You must read the atmel one ( atleast the first few pgs to get how it works). Its essentially a resistive voltage divider. The value of the touch point is determined by the ADC value read.</p>

<p><a href="http://indiantinker.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/post1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-338" alt="formula" src="http://indiantinker.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/post1.jpg" width="470" height="264" /></a></p>

<p>From the illustration above(borrowed from <a href="http://www.ti.com/lit/an/slaa384a/slaa384a.pdf" target="_blank">TI App Note</a>). One can easily see how the co-ordinates are read. In order to find out, what wire on your touch sreen corresponds to X and Y meshes. You can use a multi-meter first to measure the resistance between pins ,usually the alternate pins belong to same axes. in my case it was X-,Y-,X+,Y+  then to differentiate between x and y , one probable method will be to power the touchscreen i.e. giving the drive voltage and then find out the voltage at any other terminal w.r.t. ground and see whether is changing horizontally or vertically in your reference plane.</p>

<p><em>CAUTION: Be careful about the current while powering the touchscreen externally!</em></p>

<p>After this coding part is pretty simple. For the algo refer to page no.7 on the <a href="http://www.ti.com/lit/an/slaa384a/slaa384a.pdf" target="_blank">TI App Note</a>. If you plan to run your end application on a battery and you have hard-coded the co-ordinates and the Vdrive is sourced externally i suggest that you sample the Vdrive as well . If you are using  microcontroller pins to supply Vdrive then this can be neglected.</p>

<p>I have a desire to learn to play music but unfortunately due to my low patience levels , i have failed to keep up. :D</p>

<p>So, i made this Piano using the MSP430 Launchpad and a touchscreen along with a speaker. The code algo is pretty same as TI App Note Suggests and i encourage the reader to code it himself . Any difficulties can be discussed. It uses the<a href="http://indiantinker.wordpress.com/2012/11/29/tone-library-for-msp430/" target="_blank"> tone library</a> i posted earlier to generate the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solf%C3%A8ge" target="_blank">solfeggio</a>.</p>

        Open Agitator
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">07 Apr 2014</span>

    <p>After a somewhat woeful week at college that shook my belief in several sectors.. I mustered up my courage to realize an old project they knocked the door every time i used to Etch PCB boards. Since, the solution i use has already done close to 20 boards of small size one has to really keep shaking/stirring/Agitating the solution for a fairy long time.. ( ya 7-8 mins of man power is fairly long time :P )</p>

<p>The idea came to me when i visited my brother in <a title="Travelogue: Bangalore" href="http://indiantinker.wordpress.com/2013/05/24/travelogue-bangalore/" target="_blank">Bangalore</a> earlier this year. He was generous enough to give us a tour of his world class Biotechnology lab in India.. He showed us stuff and things/instruments which were difficult to pronounce in one go but they all had a thing in common- They ended with syllables like -<em>‘-izer’,-‘ator’,’-ation’. </em></p>

<p>One thing that they used for not allowing things/particles to sediment was called a shaker. It would be great if i could get one for myself that will take the work out of etching. When i returned i made an over-killed 3D model of the agitator that i had in mind. It would just be a 1-axis CNC with a stepper motor and belt, That was doing a lot for the task..</p>

<p>Here are some pics of the model:</p>

<p><a href="http://indiantinker.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/etchinator2.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-488" alt="Looks Cool Though.. " src="http://indiantinker.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/etchinator2.jpg" width="570" height="514" /></a> Looks Cool Though..</p>

<p><a href="http://indiantinker.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/etchinator1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-487" alt="Freewheel mount and stepper motor" src="http://indiantinker.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/etchinator1.jpg" width="633" height="466" /></a> Freewheel mount and stepper motor</p>

<p>Realizing the overkill design, I went on to an easier one earlier this month ( actually previous month ) when a relative who was ‘demolishing’ his old PC gave me some old CDROMs that didn`t work. The mechanics did work though..</p>

<p>So, I just ‘damaged’ the tracks around the main feed motor and attached my own custom circuit based around the MSP430 micro-controller and majority of TI parts as they can be shipped to anyone  with an address making it very easy to re build yourself.</p>

<p>Here is a proof-of-concept video i posted a while back where the Etchinator ( now Open Agitator after i realized it could do a lot more like cooling hot milk  :D ) was etching its own control board  :</p>

<iframe width="640" height="480" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/wOFcjrQe-is" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>I used a L293D H bridge motor controller to control the forward and backward movement of the cradle with an adjustable speed by giving a PWM on the Enable Pin . People who had made LFR’s in the first/second year know its a child`s play.</p>

<p>After running the aforementioned set up for a while i noticed that  the cradle would shift to the farther end where the gear was slightly worn out. So, when loaded the cradle would :</p>

<ol>
  <li>Latch on to that part and stay stuck.</li>
  <li>The whole system would move a bit forward each time and latch on the wrong part.</li>
</ol>

<p>So, an end-stop detection was required which would keep the cradle in the fixed portion.. some what similar to the ones i had seen in the CNC`s which tell them their legitimate playing fields.</p>

<p>The answer was using the old mouse push button that came with the CD-ROM. Its softer and probably made to withstand greater number of press-cycles than a standard SPST Tactile switch.</p>

<p>So , now the logic would work like, whenever the button/EndStop is pressed, the direction will be reversed for a fixed time and then reversed again.. So, the cycle keeps on going.. .. .. ..</p>

<p>Here is the final  schematic i came up with:</p>

<p><a href="http://indiantinker.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/sche.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-492" alt="Schematic" src="http://indiantinker.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/sche.png" width="700" height="482" /></a> Schematic</p>

<p>Since, i did’nt wanted to leave any pins un-used i included 3 LED`s which show the different states of the agitator.</p>

<p>The power supply needs special mention as it converts from a standard 12V DC adapter to 5V for the logic of the bridge (L293D) and again an <a href="http://www.ti.com/product/lp2950-33" target="_blank">LDO LP2950-3.3V</a> for the MSP430. The LDO can be sampled from TI and 7805 is available locally with every tinkerer.</p>

<p>Even the driver i.e <a href="http://www.ti.com/product/l293d" target="_blank">L293D</a> can be sourced from Ti. The brain of the device is a <a href="http://www.ti.com/product/msp430g2231" target="_blank">MSP430G2231</a> also sampled from TI and programmed from the <a href="http://www.ti.com/tool/msp-exp430g2" target="_blank">MSP430 Launchpad</a>. So, This project was indirectly sponsored by TI :D</p>

<p>The next came the board layout.. I designed it to have the least number of  vias (They can be a pain sometimes) while fitting at the back of the CD-ROM. Here is the one with just two vias.</p>

<p><a href="http://indiantinker.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/brd.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-493" alt="Board!" src="http://indiantinker.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/brd.png" width="458" height="205" /></a> Board</p>

<p>Since, the position of motor/EndStop switches were flexible they eased out the routing a bit. You can also add a DC Jack to it if you like. The files are available on github <a href="https://github.com/IndianTinker/OpenAgitator" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>Here are pictures of the final build i managed to pull off.</p>

<p><a href="http://indiantinker.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/dsc00522.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-497" alt="The EndStop" src="http://indiantinker.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/dsc00522.jpg" width="700" height="525" /></a> The EndStop</p>

<p><a href="http://indiantinker.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/dsc00521.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-503" alt="Fixed to the back of the CDROM" src="http://indiantinker.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/dsc00521.jpg" width="700" height="525" /></a> Fixed to the back of the CDROM</p>

<p>The next thing that was left was to give it a sturdy base. I choose two planks of wood that were lying around. It was essential to leave it without any base on the middle section as if ‘ever’ there is a chemical spill that can be cleaned without unscrewing the entire assembly!</p>

<p>So, Here is the final build :</p>

<p><a href="http://indiantinker.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/dsc00520.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-502" alt="Final Build" src="http://indiantinker.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/dsc00520.jpg" width="700" height="525" /></a> Final Build</p>

<p>You can fork the complete code and design from my<a href="https://github.com/IndianTinker/OpenAgitator" target="_blank"> github repo</a>.</p>

<p>Here is a video of me explaining the build.. Please ignore the following :</p>
<ul>
	<li>Bad camera quality</li>
	<li>Some goof-ups with the IC names.. Keep an eye on the Sub Titles/Captions</li>
	<li>Background Noise (if any)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Context</h4>
<p>Ten engineers passionate about making a robust vehicle that runs long distances on solar electric energy.  With almost no funds and no technical expertise in any areas on designing a car, we had to make a path of our own, amidst no support from industry.</p>

<h4>Work</h4>
<p>I was selected in the team in my first year. It was a cool feeling. We had to showcase the car and drive 3000km across Australia (Darwin—Adelaide). No amount of background is enough for the project, but I will try to keep it as concise as possible. In the initial year, I was responsible for working on telemetry and solar array fabrication of the car. I was a somehow a self-made in-charge of designing the logo, brochure, and posters for the car too. I still don’t know why did I choose those batman fonts. I guess we all are naive at some stage. The first car building was entirely funded by our college and ourselves. It was launched by the Chief Minister of the state and we received a lot of good reviews for our sleepless nights and misadventures. I had documented the process in my old blog. The stages were :</p>

<p>Our goal was to learn how to make a car that runs on solar power. We built, failed, burned, and rebuilt our own converters and circuits. Learned by doing and breaking things. Our hands were always dirty and mind always busy solving some problems.  Finally, we did build a working car, certified to run on international roads.  The race in Australia was great. We had the lowest cost car in the competition. Or we did not know why things could be so expensive. The cost of competing was more than the cost of building the car for us. The rough estimate is about 10 times cheaper. We did complete the race, but our mileage was about 11%. Crossing the line mattered a lot to us, sweating it out to learn and without support from the industry. We built a parent-sourced car.  In the next year, we decided to build a more utilitarian passenger car. Our previous failures helped us and we were able to build one in record time. This time we used curved panels adapted to our body too. We learned this from friends from Germany, Singapore, and Iran while in Australia. The current car drew more attention and was inaugurated by the President of India, Pranab Mukherjee. It was faster and a bit conventional. I hope we furthered the thinking in this space with our work. In the end, we moved out of the team and the juniors carried it on. Some of the people in the team now work for good automotive companies like Tesla, Tata Motors, Hero, and Google.</p>

<p><strong>Learnings</strong>: The learnings were immense. We traveled to Australia and camped in deserts, in forests and wherever we stopped. I have tons of stories to tell about these things. We had to manage a lot of finances ourselves. So, we learned cost analysis down to the component level. I learned a lot on DIY, making, and electronics in general. This helped me with my hobbies and work under Prof. Gadre. The experience made me realize the value of working in a team. We all slogged and made it through.</p>
