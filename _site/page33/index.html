      <a href="/2014/07/24/Hyderabad/">
        The Hyderabad Quickie !
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">24 Jul 2014</span>

    <p>I was recently in South Indian city of Hyderabad, the capital of Andhra Pradesh (Now reorganized into two states called Telangana and Seemandhra ). The city is know for its Biryani and Char Minar.</p>

<p>Due the schedule , i could only get a day (rather a combination of one evening and one morning ) to explore  the Nawabi city. Thankfully, the city has an awesome public transportation system with buses and feeders plying to every nook and corner of the city. On the iteneary, we planned to visit Golconda Fort, Hussain Sagar, Char Minar and adjoining area and Banjara Hills.</p>

<p>Luckily, we were based around Medhipatnam area, which provided easy access to most of the above places.</p>

<p>The weather here was a bit cooler and moist than my home Delhi, which was literally breaking all time temperature records. Hyderabad is a densely populated city. Unlike most south indian cities, due to the large Muslim population who speak Urdu, there is no problem for a Hindi speaking tourist here. The state predominantly speaks Telugu and has some “super-awesome-Newton-defying” movies,some of which i watched during the bus route from Chennai to Hyderabad.</p>
<p align="center"><a title="#Hyderabad #Ramzan #Mosque #India #Travel by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/14346467217"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3912/14346467217_03878e7626.jpg" alt="#Hyderabad #Ramzan #Mosque #India #Travel" width="500" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>Since, Golconda was nearest , we boarded the bus that dropped us at the gate of Golconda Fort. The Fort seemed massive. It seemed to have some features of both Hindu and Muslim architectural elements which confused me about its origins.At the entry, there is an interesting demonstration, that a couple of guides will give you like a “30- Day Anti virus Trial” . In the middle of section after the entry, when you clap , a lot of beats are generated that can be heard at different <strong>strategic</strong> parts of the Fort that were used as a signal. But when you move a few steps away from the centre, no beats are heard.</p>

<p>Some pretty cool sound engineering from the past. These are generated due to these structures on the roof above.</p>
<p align="center"><a title="Beat Generation Mechanism at Golconda Fort by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/14630690493"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3852/14630690493_f40566d0e6_c.jpg" alt="Beat Generation Mechanism at Golconda Fort" width="800" height="449" /></a></p>
<p>We bought a paper guide and started following the tour it promised. As we moved we saw this place where soldiers used to rest and take positions.Quite a popular picture spot it seems.</p>
<p align="center"><a title="Golconda Fort by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/14424022510"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3884/14424022510_50d846662f_c.jpg" alt="Golconda Fort" width="800" height="449" /></a></p>
<p align="center"><a title="Golconda Fort by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/14424261797"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5532/14424261797_ce9f82f670_c.jpg" alt="Golconda Fort" width="800" height="449" /></a></p>
<p align="center"><a title="Golconda Fort by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/14424249117"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2909/14424249117_dfa0fb6aa6_c.jpg" alt="Golconda Fort" width="800" height="449" /></a></p>
<p>As we moved on, we approached a point where we had to start our journey of 350 stairs to reach to the top of the fort.</p>

<p>I saw some interesting thing on the stairs. There were marks on the stairs with a yellow background and red finger marks on all of them.</p>
<p align="center"><a title="Stairs at Golconda Fort by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/14587642846"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5472/14587642846_c8bef07ab6_c.jpg" alt="Stairs at Golconda Fort" width="800" height="449" /></a></p>
<p>When asked from a passer-by he explained that this is a part of ritual performed here as there is a temple on the top.</p>

<p>As we climbed, the air started to get a bit cooler and fresher. We could see the Fort is mostly in ruins and most of the things that it presumably had are only in books or in the guides like the one i had in my hand.</p>

<p>As we moved up stairs, we saw a mosque which was closed to visitors. There was also a jail which has an interesting story. It is said that, there the <em>Munshi</em> ( The Head of Accounts) of the king was once held there because he paid from the coffers to help build a temple without the kings permission. Then after several years, God came in king’s dream and asked him to free him. He was freed that very night. There is a temple there now.</p>
<p align="center"><a title="Mosque at Golconda Fort by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/14607389671"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2905/14607389671_c29bd1893e_c.jpg" alt="Mosque at Golconda Fort" width="800" height="449" /></a></p>
<p>Next, we moved to the top most point we could see the bigger picture. Most structures were in shambles. Here is the panorama from the top most point .</p>
<p align="center"><a title="Golconda Fort Panaroma by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/14607376441"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3856/14607376441_1e5c9067cb_c.jpg" alt="Golconda Fort Panaroma" width="800" height="205" /></a></p>
<p align="center"><a title="View From Golconda Fort by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/14610602565"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3876/14610602565_93e5728c06_c.jpg" alt="View From Golconda Fort" width="800" height="449" /></a></p>
<p>From the top, we could see the entire city of hyderabad. We caught a person vandalising the walls and asked him to stop. He ran away, but as we were decending we saw him writing with a charcoal on the walls of the place where the king’s <em>Darbar</em> meetings were held.</p>
<p align="center"><a title="Golconda Fort by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/14423980878"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2913/14423980878_6535fed118_c.jpg" alt="Golconda Fort" width="800" height="449" /></a></p>
<p align="center"><a title="Mass Vandalisation at Golconda Fort by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/14424018079"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3926/14424018079_1ba8f697e6_c.jpg" alt="Mass Vandalisation at Golconda Fort" width="800" height="449" /></a></p>
<p>As we descended, we could see ruined arches and rooms that once housed the dignitaries of the king.</p>
<p align="center"><a title="Golconda Fort by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/14610042952"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5544/14610042952_cd80c37733_c.jpg" alt="Golconda Fort" width="800" height="449" /></a></p>
<p align="center"><a title="Golconda Fort-Arches by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/14424189507"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2925/14424189507_53f598d4e6_c.jpg" alt="Golconda Fort-Arches" width="800" height="449" /></a></p>
<p align="center"><a title="Golconda Fort by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/14610579675"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2904/14610579675_67d8ec7b25_c.jpg" alt="Golconda Fort" width="800" height="449" /></a></p>
<p>Below, is the room where the queen(S) used to live.</p>
<p align="center"><a title="Golconda Fort by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/14423941340"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3890/14423941340_457e3880d0_c.jpg" alt="Golconda Fort" width="800" height="449" /></a></p>
<p>Next we moved to the place where artillery was stored. These large iron balls were propelled by cannons apart from the famous hot oil protection scheme to save the fort. I remember, the hot oil was also used to protect Kangra Fort, in Himachal Pradesh.</p>
<p align="center"><a title="Artillery at Fort by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/14610572335"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2897/14610572335_a09ca59525_c.jpg" alt="Artillery at Fort" width="800" height="449" /></a></p>
<p>After this fort walk, we exited the complex and moved to the Bus Stand and sipped a couple of tender coconuts while we waited for the bus.</p>

<p>Next we moved to the Hussain Sagar Lake, Again we got a direct bus leading to the lake’s gate. Like the fort, the lake was huge. So, huge that there were ferries running in the lake to take visitors to the large statue of Lord Buddha. There is a small amusement park that has been set up for kids.</p>
<p align="center"><a title="Hussain Sagar Lake by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/14610740115"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2940/14610740115_64143ab2a1_c.jpg" alt="Hussain Sagar Lake" width="800" height="449" /></a></p>
<p>The sunset near the boarding point.</p>

<p>The ferries take 5-10min and drop you at the Statue where you can stay as long as you want and catch any ferry back. The statue is decorated with beautiful lights.</p>
<p align="center"><a title="Hussain Sagar Lake by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/14608670264"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3883/14608670264_2e412480ec_c.jpg" alt="Hussain Sagar Lake" width="800" height="449" /></a></p>
<p align="center"><a title="Buddha Statue in the middle of Hussain Sagar Lake by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/14424140179"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5314/14424140179_90023e4734_c.jpg" alt="Buddha Statue in the middle of Hussain Sagar Lake" width="449" height="800" /></a></p>
<p>After spending some time there, we made a quick exit and caught the next bus to the Epic Charminar. With thoughts of Biriyani for which i have been running almost empty stomach  i boarded the bus.It took us about 30 minutes to reach. A couple of minutes of walk, an there stood the Charminar.</p>
<p align="center"><a title="Busy Streets near Char Minar by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/14587711756"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3904/14587711756_03cf3a2853_c.jpg" alt="Busy Streets near Char Minar" width="800" height="449" /></a></p>
<p>This was not the correct time to visit the place. It was jam packed. The streets has shops selling pearls, fruits, clothes and bakery items. We moved closer.</p>
<p align="center"><a title="Char Minar by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/14424080170"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5582/14424080170_fe8936a715_c.jpg" alt="Char Minar" width="800" height="449" /></a></p>
<p>The crowd density increased. We could now see the Char minar a bit clearly, The site was highly polluted. The vehicles were running too close to the monument and the pollutants were quite evidently damaging the monument.</p>

<p>We say an interesting site that depicted, the diversity in our country. A Temple inside a Char Minar. #ProudIndian</p>

<p>The issue was Biriyani. We searched the famous shops but none of them served Vegetarian Biriyani. One person suggested us, to go to a shop down the lane and supposedly the only one to serve veg biriyani. Ah! Delighted :)</p>

<p>Biriyani is like pulao but with an overdose of clove, cinammon and some secret ingredients . After having this delicious Biriyani, we started our way back to the Hotel. On the way we stopped at Banjara Hills, Its the CP of Hyderabad, picked up a Sundae and headed back.</p>

<p>If you visit the CharMinar area and Banjara Hills in the order, you would see how the country is moving forward, Preserving the culture and the soul of its existence as well as We are going in hand with the more developed outlook and are leading the world in some things!</p>

<p>Cheers :)</p>

        UberCubeX4- The portable LED Cube !
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">22 Jul 2014</span>

    <p>I recently made a led cube. It is a project i was dreaming to fiddle with for quite a while(<del>years</del>). I finally managed to make one. Here is the complete video of the demonstration.Its basically a 4x4x4 Led Cube with various patterns programmed into it. I made it during Diwali-The Indian Festival of lights. The entire build procedure is documented in the video.</p>

<iframe width="640" height="480" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/8qF-NFmNIvc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>The process starts by arranging the LEDs in a uniformly spaced fashion. To do so, I used an old <em>TI Samples Box</em> and made a 2cm grid on it. The grid resolution depends on the length of the LED leads, the ones that i have are pretty small.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/17032377895" title="UberCubeJig by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8748/17032377895_63b65458f0_z.jpg" width="640" height="359" alt="UberCubeJig" /></a></p>

<p>Now once in the jig, you arrange them as shown. Until you finally get 8 such combinations to obtain 2x 4x4x2 Cuboid which will ultimately make up a 4x4x4 . <strong>Some Hard work Required.</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/16846178389" title="FinalStac by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8699/16846178389_5414d56de5_z.jpg" width="640" height="359" alt="FinalStac" /></a></p>

<p>Now stack them up on a perfboard and remember to drill mounting holes before hand to avoid your castle being demolished by some wayward drilling.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/17006413856" title="AssembledonPerfboard by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8704/17006413856_78dddce56b_z.jpg" width="640" height="359" alt="AssembledonPerfboard" /></a></p>

<p>Since its always better to test the setup/circuit before going on the final assembling and play around with the code on the breadboard. We solder some headers to the Cube and embed them in the breadboard. The connections are such that all the steps of the two half-cubes 2X4 which are negatives are driven by the darlington and hence connected together on one header. The corresponding column of each half cube is connected and brought to the header.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/16412234233" title="Prototyping by Rohit Gupta, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7633/16412234233_b0fc5f0876_z.jpg" width="640" height="359" alt="Prototyping" /></a></p>

<p>The MCU enters the scene. The MCU of choice is TI MSP430g2553 which along with the ULN2803 driver will run the cube.

<p>Once the circuit and code is almost final. I designed the PCB (<em>All SMD ! Yeah \m/</em> ) using Eagle and etched the same to the PCB.</p>

<p>The Soldered one!

<p>The PCB looked beautiful and the fragile project deserved the more stronger structure. So, I designed an outer cover for the base to be laser cut in a combination of wood(2.8mm) and acrylic(3mm).</p>

<p>Power Switch and DC Jack for power.

        Tiano- The Touchscreen Piano
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">16 Apr 2014</span>

    <p>Touchscreens..huh.. They are all around us..Phones ,tablets, phablets and now even laptops. Most of them have a capacitive touchscreen where the change in capacitance at a point is used to sense it and then perform the corresponding action. Capacitive ones are multi point sensing. They sense more than 2 points and hence we get those pinch to zoom features etc.</p>

<p>On the other hand , almost archaic version on touchscreen is the resistive version. That are pretty easy to interface with almost any microcontroller with an ADC. In this project i did over the weekend i tried to interface a touchscreen ( resistive one..) ,available at mobile repair shops in Delhi with a MSP430G2553 (Although MSP430G2231 would also do)  to make a piano.</p>

<p><a href="http://indiantinker.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/touchscreen-setup.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-339" alt="Touchscreen setup" src="http://indiantinker.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/touchscreen-setup.jpg" width="470" height="230" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Pre-requisites</strong>: The touchscreen may not be easier to get. I got mine from a mobile repair shop in LR. It is a 4-wire Touchscreen, pretty common with horribly thin contacts that took a lot of patience to solder.There is a lot of literature available on Touchscreens on the internet. I found two app notes that were best. First one from <a href="http://www.atmel.in/Images/doc8091.pdf" target="_blank">Atmel</a> , that explained the working of the touchsreen in a pretty clear way and one from <a href="http://www.ti.com/lit/an/slaa384a/slaa384a.pdf" target="_blank">TI</a> that some what helped in the software part.</p>

<p>You must read the atmel one ( atleast the first few pgs to get how it works). Its essentially a resistive voltage divider. The value of the touch point is determined by the ADC value read.</p>

<p><a href="http://indiantinker.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/post1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-338" alt="formula" src="http://indiantinker.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/post1.jpg" width="470" height="264" /></a></p>

<p>From the illustration above(borrowed from <a href="http://www.ti.com/lit/an/slaa384a/slaa384a.pdf" target="_blank">TI App Note</a>). One can easily see how the co-ordinates are read. In order to find out, what wire on your touch sreen corresponds to X and Y meshes. You can use a multi-meter first to measure the resistance between pins ,usually the alternate pins belong to same axes. in my case it was X-,Y-,X+,Y+  then to differentiate between x and y , one probable method will be to power the touchscreen i.e. giving the drive voltage and then find out the voltage at any other terminal w.r.t. ground and see whether is changing horizontally or vertically in your reference plane.</p>

<p><em>CAUTION: Be careful about the current while powering the touchscreen externally!</em></p>

<p>After this coding part is pretty simple. For the algo refer to page no.7 on the <a href="http://www.ti.com/lit/an/slaa384a/slaa384a.pdf" target="_blank">TI App Note</a>. If you plan to run your end application on a battery and you have hard-coded the co-ordinates and the Vdrive is sourced externally i suggest that you sample the Vdrive as well . If you are using  microcontroller pins to supply Vdrive then this can be neglected.</p>

<p>I have a desire to learn to play music but unfortunately due to my low patience levels , i have failed to keep up. :D</p>

<p>So, i made this Piano using the MSP430 Launchpad and a touchscreen along with a speaker. The code algo is pretty same as TI App Note Suggests and i encourage the reader to code it himself . Any difficulties can be discussed. It uses the<a href="http://indiantinker.wordpress.com/2012/11/29/tone-library-for-msp430/" target="_blank"> tone library</a> i posted earlier to generate the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solf%C3%A8ge" target="_blank">solfeggio</a>.</p>
