  &lt;p&gt;This article talks about how to accept Alipay payments using Stripe. PS: I am not a front-end person. Heck, I don’t really know what is my discipline, but anyways, this is just a suggestive guide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;context&quot;&gt;Context&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One fine summer day, hanging out with my friend, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/creativemutation/&quot;&gt;Aman&lt;/a&gt; and playing with his Oculus, a problem surfaced. He is having troubles accepting payments from his chinese clients. Many of them use Alipay to pay, but unfortunately he is not able to accept that on his website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;BTW, he runs a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cademy.xyz/&quot;&gt;cool school&lt;/a&gt; that teaches people computational design and how to use it in product design realm. Do check him out. His school is &lt;strong&gt;post paid&lt;/strong&gt; as it is aimed at students. Very interesting model.. he screens and talks to each student to account for purchase power parity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He uses &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/&quot;&gt;Stripe&lt;/a&gt; on his Squarespace website and everything is no-code (yeah! cool people things.). The power of these tools is pretty baffling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;problem&quot;&gt;Problem&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, so, sipping some &lt;em&gt;tinto de verano&lt;/em&gt; we had a problem that a Chinese student who has already attended one of his live classes needs to pay using Alipay. The conventional Stripe payment did not work. The customer care of Squarespace (that integrates Stripe) asked him to contact Stripe and Stripe’s documentation can be baffling sometimes. He was stuck 😔&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;solution&quot;&gt;Solution&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, over the last weekend, we worked together to implement a way to accept alipay payments using Stripe. It is not yet integrated into squarespace . For the test, We used the direct session link. #NotBuiltForScale&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully, this write-up helps people integrate Alipay in their payment stacks and provides template code to do so. Surprisingly, this needs a simple server script that generates the payment session and hence, cannot be done entirely client-only. It beats me why, but as Old John says, this is what it is. 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this example, I used &lt;a href=&quot;https://nuxtjs.org/&quot;&gt;Nuxtjs&lt;/a&gt; (Like Next but for Vue 💚 ) with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://vuestripe.com&quot;&gt;vue-stripe&lt;/a&gt; plugin. The Nuxt SPA calls a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.deta.sh&quot;&gt;deta microservice endpoint&lt;/a&gt; to generate a payment session on Stripe. The micro-service responds with sessionID generated. This session ID is used to redirect the customer to payment page. Our flow is based on the method described by stripe’s documentation &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/docs/payments/alipay/accept-a-payment?platform=checkout&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will only be sharing the code for the ‘glue’ micro-service and sample vue page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The schematic (drawn by yours truly) is as follows :
&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/kEV5cLC.png&quot; alt=&quot;alt&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, lets go step by step (&lt;em&gt;paso a paso&lt;/em&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&quot;step-1-&quot;&gt;Step 1 :&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nuxt and Axios are pretty common things as far as some front-end folks tell me. But to accept money, you need a payment partner. This payment partner will take our customer’s data to the payment handler (like VISA/ Mastercard) and make sure we get the money. Stripe is a service like that. &lt;br /&gt; Now to talk to stripe, from our webapp, I used a plugin called &lt;a href=&quot;(https://vuestripe.com)&quot;&gt;vue-stripe&lt;/a&gt;. It is an official plugin for Vue/Nuxt and nicely documented. The plugin, helps package data and make calls in such a way that stripe standards are respected. If you are not doing something special (like us), the examples are just copy paste away from deploy. But…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&quot;step-2-&quot;&gt;Step 2 :&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our case, we need to accept Alipay. Alipay (for reasons i do not know) cannot be accepted entirely using a client-only implementation. This took me a while to figure out. So, we need to write a server side script that takes in our data and generates a &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/en-in/payments/payment-links&quot;&gt;checkout session&lt;/a&gt;. To do this, I used Deta.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;(https://www.deta.sh)&quot;&gt;Deta&lt;/a&gt; is a service that deploys and runs nodejs/python scripts on the cloud. It gives you an end-point to talk to. I have been playing with it for mostly useless things until now. &lt;br /&gt; Interestingly enough,  I have come to prefer it over netlify functions as :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Its entirely free&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the deploy speed is very fast&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Toolchain is intuitive&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/detahq&quot;&gt;team&lt;/a&gt; is adorable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The function shown below takes in our POST request from Nuxt front-end and passes it to stripe’s servers. We have added alipay as a payment method to support in this particular session. Then, it returns a checkout session ID as a response. The session ID is consumed by the nuxt app as explained in Step 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot; data-lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;express&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;express&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;app&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;express&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The checkout session ID is passed to the vue-stripe plugin (based on example &lt;a href=&quot;https://vuestripe.com/stripe-checkout/sessions&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) which redirects the client to the payment page. The vue-page can be constructed like shown below.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After, if you deploying everything, Lets click the checkout button. Tadaaa 🎉! It shows Alipay as a possible payment option. 
&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/f6aMVGH.png&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps someone on the internet. I &lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt; stress again, I am not a front-end developer, I just did this for fun. If anyone has any constructive criticism, I am open to learn :-)
&lt;br /&gt;
With this hope,

&lt;/ol&gt;</content><author><name>Rohit</name></author><category term="front-end" /><summary type="html">This article talks about how to accept Alipay payments using Stripe. PS: I am not a front-end person. Heck, I don’t really know what is my discipline, but anyways, this is just a suggestive guide. Context One fine summer day, hanging out with my friend, Aman and playing with his Oculus, a problem surfaced. He is having troubles accepting payments from his chinese clients. Many of them use Alipay to pay, but unfortunately he is not able to accept that on his website. BTW, he runs a cool school that teaches people computational design and how to use it in product design realm. Do check him out. His school is post paid as it is aimed at students. Very interesting model.. he screens and talks to each student to account for purchase power parity. He uses Stripe on his Squarespace website and everything is no-code (yeah! cool people things.). The power of these tools is pretty baffling. Problem Anyways, so, sipping some tinto de verano we had a problem that a Chinese student who has already attended one of his live classes needs to pay using Alipay. The conventional Stripe payment did not work. The customer care of Squarespace (that integrates Stripe) asked him to contact Stripe and Stripe’s documentation can be baffling sometimes. He was stuck 😔 Solution So, over the last weekend, we worked together to implement a way to accept alipay payments using Stripe. It is not yet integrated into squarespace . For the test, We used the direct session link. #NotBuiltForScale Hopefully, this write-up helps people integrate Alipay in their payment stacks and provides template code to do so. Surprisingly, this needs a simple server script that generates the payment session and hence, cannot be done entirely client-only. It beats me why, but as Old John says, this is what it is. For this example, I used Nuxtjs (Like Next but for Vue 💚 ) with the vue-stripe plugin. The Nuxt SPA calls a deta microservice endpoint to generate a payment session on Stripe. The micro-service responds with sessionID generated. This session ID is used to redirect the customer to payment page. Our flow is based on the method described by stripe’s documentation here. I will only be sharing the code for the ‘glue’ micro-service and sample vue page. The schematic (drawn by yours truly) is as follows : So, lets go step by step (paso a paso): Step 1 : Nuxt and Axios are pretty common things as far as some front-end folks tell me. But to accept money, you need a payment partner. This payment partner will take our customer’s data to the payment handler (like VISA/ Mastercard) and make sure we get the money. Stripe is a service like that. Now to talk to stripe, from our webapp, I used a plugin called vue-stripe. It is an official plugin for Vue/Nuxt and nicely documented. The plugin, helps package data and make calls in such a way that stripe standards are respected. If you are not doing something special (like us), the examples are just copy paste away from deploy. But… Step 2 : In our case, we need to accept Alipay. Alipay (for reasons i do not know) cannot be accepted entirely using a client-only implementation. This took me a while to figure out. So, we need to write a server side script that takes in our data and generates a checkout session. To do this, I used Deta. Deta is a service that deploys and runs nodejs/python scripts on the cloud. It gives you an end-point to talk to. I have been playing with it for mostly useless things until now. Interestingly enough, I have come to prefer it over netlify functions as : Its entirely free the deploy speed is very fast The Toolchain is intuitive The team is adorable. The function shown below takes in our POST request from Nuxt front-end and passes it to stripe’s servers. We have added alipay as a payment method to support in this particular session. Then, it returns a checkout session ID as a response. The session ID is consumed by the nuxt app as explained in Step 3. const express = require('express') const app = express() const cors = require('cors'); const stripe = require('stripe')('sk_xxxxxxx') //Your stripe key here, better get it as an env variable //Some CORS magic app.use(cors({ origin: true })); app.use((req, res, next) =&amp;gt; { res.set('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*'); next(); }); app.post('/payments', async (req, res) =&amp;gt; { const session = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create({ payment_method_types: ['card','alipay'], // We added Alipay as show above line_items: [ { price: 'price_xxxxxxxx', // The id of the one-time price you created in your Stripe dashboard quantity: 1, } ], mode: 'payment', success_url: 'https://www.yoursite.xyz/paymentSuccess', cancel_url: 'https://www.yoursite.xyz/paymentFailed', }); console.log(session); sessionData={ &quot;id&quot;:session.id, // The ID we need &quot;url&quot; : session.url //If you wish you can directly redirect to this as well } res.send(sessionData); }) // export 'app' module.exports = app For more info on getting started with Deta Micros, check this page. Step 3 : The checkout session ID is passed to the vue-stripe plugin (based on example here) which redirects the client to the payment page. The vue-page can be constructed like shown below. &amp;lt;template&amp;gt; &amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;stripe-checkout ref=&quot;checkoutRef&quot; :pk=&quot;publishableKey&quot; :session-id=&quot;sessionId&quot; /&amp;gt; &amp;lt;button @click=&quot;getPaymentID&quot;&amp;gt;Checkout!&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/template&amp;gt; &amp;lt;script&amp;gt; import { StripeCheckout } from &quot;@vue-stripe/vue-stripe&quot;; export default { components: { StripeCheckout }, data() { this.publishableKey = &quot;pk_test_xxxxxxx&quot;; //Your publishable key from stripe, better to get it as an env variable return { loading: false, sessionId: null // session id from backend }; }, methods: { async getPaymentID() { const sessionData = await this.$axios.$post(&quot;https://something.deta.dev/payments&quot;); this.sessionId= sessionData.id this.$refs.checkoutRef.redirectToCheckout(); }, } }; &amp;lt;/script&amp;gt; After, if you deploying everything, Lets click the checkout button.

  &lt;p&gt;This article is about slowness — the lack of sense of speed in life, why we need it and why we don’t seem to get it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;criminalization-of-slowness&quot;&gt;Criminalization of slowness&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many times and many things have to be done fast. No one asks &lt;em&gt;Why&lt;/em&gt;? 
Fast food, Fast design (Design Thinking), Fast Code (Lean, Sprint, Agile) all lead to bad health, eventually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Details are lost. There is no fun. The society or the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/11/accelerationism-how-a-fringe-philosophy-predicted-the-future-we-live-in&quot;&gt;accelerationist&lt;/a&gt; environment of progress criminalizes for slowly done work. &lt;a href=&quot;https://fs.blog/2021/05/slack/&quot;&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt; is punished and tasks are automated. As you gain time for being fast, the joy one gets from the task is not there. The immersion is superficial and checklist-y. There is always a server or process to blame for the lack of fun. No wonder many fast jobs are no longer creative but are creativity served like Big Mc Burger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast, IMO, is largely a marketed trait and not a natural, required one. Humans cannot be fast in everything, we are slow animals. Remember the last time you were expecting something to be fast. Was it at a home delivery ? Or was it running at the cost of not enjoying? Most of this ‘need for speed’ is actually not needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;need-for-speed-in-the-pandemic&quot;&gt;Need for Speed in the pandemic&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As they say that the depth is in the details. Details seem to take more time to consume. The lowering attention span is already a pandemic fueled by the many attention kidnapping apps. Then there are all these things about reading 300 books a year, listening to 10x podcasts, and blah blah. You get that. The point is, being on the surface and consuming thing (podcasts, books, etc) does not leave time enough for that essential reflection to truly see the depth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pandemic seems to have increased this as well. As we all, lay trapped in a cabin, working and watching, there is a reinvention pressure. Binging to stay ahead of the Netflix buffet seems to be quite predominant. FYI, Netflix considers a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/netflix-viewership-two-minutes/&quot;&gt;viewing time for more than 2 minutes&lt;/a&gt; as a view. Seldom do viewers pay attention to the way the shot has been composed and lately, the directors have lost ‘that’ cinematic attention (again IMO). Many friends watch shows for several seasons only to forget what they were about. They do give a good rating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;slowness-and-learning&quot;&gt;Slowness and Learning&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many skills are best learned when we start slowly. Like slow, SLOW. As Dreyfus Model of Skills suggests, slowly copying without striving to post on instagram yet!🤭&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Especially with sports, If one is training to run for a marathon, it is the ability to consistently run at slower speeds and save the boost for later. Murakami often recounts this in his book , &lt;em&gt;What I Talk About When I Talk About Running&lt;/em&gt;. It does get very irritating as we begin. My runner friend, Ben, always suggests me to run for a longer time than for longer distances or lesser times. I guess it’s the same when you learning music. The tempo is slow, but that is required for muscle memory to build up.  &lt;br /&gt;
John Cleese talks about it in the section of his book, &lt;em&gt;Creativity: A Short and Cheerful Guide&lt;/em&gt; on “Tortoise brain” and “Hare Brain”. He largely attributes the Tortoise brain to unconscious processes and the Hare brain that gets things done. Hence, we need both and not just mindless running.&lt;br /&gt;
So, I want to make a point that there seems to be value in not being fast all the time. Maybe a bit slow can help us all. Slow is not lazy. Fast is not all bad. A good mix of reflection, conscious consumption, and production seem to be the key. Like this beer commercial from Madrid, asking you to live without haste.

This article may seem like a rant or an observation. However, I am trying to make a case for slow. I have a simpler follow-up article on some habit or rituals, I have been experimenting with to cope with these experiences. I hope I can edit that soon and put it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;i&gt;Sorry! I could not see you.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;He cried,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sorry! I left you alone&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;He wept.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sorry! I was not there&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;He wrote.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;i&gt;As smoke carried his grandpa&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt; He stood there.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The smoke is what were are&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;he once said&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;and smoke is what he became &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;in the end. &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
My grandfather, Gopi Ram, passed away yesterday due to complications from CoVID. I dearly miss him. I am terribly sad that I could not see him in time as I was too busy getting my paperwork in Spain. He kept asking me when I would go and I kept having reasons. But, I guess, I could not meet him in the end. I missed it. Only a few could. The state is a black box. They took him and wrapped him in a protocol. The whole family is shocked and helpless. We are emotionally quarantining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/1MGQLjQ.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mourn his death, I write this as a memoir to him and his memory in me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My grandfather came from a agrarian background. He was born in those times when personal histories were not tracked and little do I know of his background. He was one of the few in his entire family who worked hard and made sure that he is educated. All of us and my cousins are indebted to his spirit of educating every single one of his grandchildren. Most of them have PhDs (except a few like me) and are leading researchers and educators, thanks to him.
&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Born in a colonial India, he studied in Urdu, English, and Hindi. His English was way better than mine is today. I remember sitting in the less polluted Delhi sun, besides him, as he read to me and corrected my homework. He went on to work with the Railways while India was getting its independence from our previous rulers. He was an engineer and a Doer. One can still spot his name on some train stations in India. The one in Benares (now Varanasi) bears his name, my cousin tells me. He was scholarly and was once one of the best students in the state in old times. The ‘Maker’ in me was born out of his upbringing. We would make things with his fancy tool case filled with Victorian Colonial tools. He exposed me to the idea of crafting things from hands and how one should always respect the tools. He was a true maker till the very last weeks. Making and repairing his tools, appliances, and vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A government worker, I often have heard stories of him being transferred because he took his stand on things that mattered and that is what he told us all from a young age. Be on the side of hard-work, struggle, and patience. Believe in yourself and god. Never tell anyone off and help whoever you can. He used to teach us. He was transferred a lot and picked up languages wherever he went. I learned this from him. My uncles were all born in different cities as the family moved until finally they all settled in what is now Delhi. But, he would still tell stories of his upbringing in small villages of Haryana.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/CmcIpD5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was a fan of tea and would make it for me and my grandmother. In those tea times, I used to sit in his room. We used to all stay together in a big house. F-55 was our address, until we moved and separated. All the elderly in the locality would come and have tea with us. The local pundit would join sometimes and so would our neighbors. They would talk about politics and we would watch TV all the time. He was the only one who had a good cable TV and I remember watching Discovery Channel in Hindi all day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/yAz3Py0.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In India, kids are (or used to be) mostly raised by the family as a unit. The family as a unit is strong and takes care of everyone. The government just exists to take taxes and do some construction. The family is the institution that raises you and provides you with your values and moral code of conduct. In my particular case, my upbringing, after I was 5 years old was influenced by my grandparents more than usual. In 1997, my siblings were born and they were affected by Cerebral Palsy. My parents would take them to doctors all around the country and I would stay with my grandparents in these times. He would dress me up and take me to the school bus stop and then later pick me up as well. I have fond memories of my grandfather cooking for me and taking me to the roadside guy, who also cuts hair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the evenings, he taught me how to ride the bicycle and later his scooty (a two stroke two wheeler without gear). My friends would be surprised to see me ride it at a young age, underage of course. My grandfather, said that we should be independent. Only an independent person, can help the society. I remember his routine of taking out tiny pebbles stuck in tyres of his scooter as they reduce the life of the tyres. I do that with my running shoes as well. He always took care of whatever he had. “You should take care of things and they will take care of you”. Obviously, the Airbnb generation wont get that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/NNr20oI.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was a devout Hindu and use to go to temple everyday. He was involved with charity and always told us that even in times of hardship one should remember the almighty. Every Tuesdays, I and my father used to visit him at his place. We had moved as our old house was not disabled friendly and my siblings were getting too old to carry 3 floors. He used to get something sweet for me on every Tuesday. I get my sweet tooth from him, for those of you who know me. He used to enquire about my studies and work and told me to not hesitate in any way to ask if I needed some support. He was very kind. Then, I would eay half my dinner as my grandparents would force me to do so and I would eat the other half at home. After dinner, he would ask me to take one of his ‘seenkhs’, a twig from neem tree to floss the teeth after having food. I loved the bitter taste and would have the twig sticking out of my mouth to look cool. So, Tuesdays were half-dinner neem twig days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
He was an immensely active person. Hyperactivity flows in our family. I get it from him as well. Even a few days before his untimely death, he would go on walks and go shopping on his now ‘electric’ scooty, all by himself. He had been operated for a bypass about a decade back and have been doing fine since then. 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember him calling me on my birthday every year. I guess, there will be no call this year and I wished him happy birthday on 1st April recently. I did write to him sometimes and I guess tomorrow there will be no &lt;strong&gt;good morning&lt;/strong&gt; from him on my Whatsapp anymore. He used to send my images of gods and moral values, so they can take care of me. I guess, as he becomes a star now, those images would protect me and make sure I am taken care of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- In his last years, he was typically concerned about the state of our family. He wanted us all to be more close together. He often mentioned about my cousins not writing to him. --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/rXQhecZ.png&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel sad to have sometimes ignored his sending me random messages. I am sorry! I was being a bad &lt;em&gt;pota&lt;/em&gt; ! I am terribly sad for my ignorance. Sometimes, we just leave people in background and forget how foundational they are to us. Until, there is an earthquake and the pillows are filled with tears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a similar feeling when my maternal grandmother (nani) passed away. I was typically close to her and my paternal grandfather (dada). Both have now passed away. I feel their absence, loss of care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/rGCXogn.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;img&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess, I cannot do anything anymore. As helpless as we have become, these days, in all our fictional liberties. The whole country is burning with fire from the pyres and dug up for graves. My loss remains a small part of it. A systemic failure of our ‘ancient’ culture. As India becomes a global unicorn birthing machine, we still struggle to treat our sick and remain hungry. What good is such wealth ?, just numbers and so is my grandfather, a number in the death count of your news daily. All that has become of life is just petty numbers. My grandfather used to tell me to never get attached to wealth and always be attached to morals and values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will mourn him as much as I can, alone, away from my parents and family. The best way to do that is follow what he dreamt of me to do. To be a good person and respect and help everyone be a better version of themselves. I hope I find a closure and he finds peace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Om shanti !&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Dear friends/readers in India, please stay safe and take care of your elderly. This is like a war where the government has given up and is still stuck in a colonial hangover. Our elderly and weak are on the battlefront as still find ways to tackle these viruses.&lt;/p&gt;

I was away for a bit. The reasons were described in the previous post. I had already written a part of the post an year back. Since then, I did manage to read a few more books and reflect on what could have been more useful for IDC students. Things that could have provided a better understanding of the “design” industry. I have, hence, updated the list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me know what you think about the list. 
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This list is probably more useful during the other half of your time at IDC (P2,P3, and Placements). The second part of the list concerns with ‘nature’ of design as a practice in the industry and how to take it. Fortunately (and also in a quite palatable way), most of the students get their first job through campus placements at IDC. So the struggle is minimal anyways. But the books, will anyhow help you to get out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Design for the real world — Victor Papanek&lt;br /&gt;
This is a great book to read on the nature of design that impacts the real world (outside the fastest new gadget out there). A book that greatly helped me develop the ‘designer’ ethos and avoid the ‘cool and indifferent designer’ trap. The book discusses various ways to think about design and could be helpful in finding possible opportunities and processes to follow for projects and life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Design is basic to all human activities - the placing and patterning of any act towards a desired goal constitutes a design process.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Siddhartha — Herman Hesse&lt;br /&gt;
This is probably the book I have gifted the most. I just love it. This is not a counter-top mindfulness pill but rather a book that teaches the value of struggle and patience. Design could be better with a more patient mindset.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Wisdom cannot be imparted. Wisdom that a wise man attempts to impart always sounds like foolishness to someone else … Knowledge can be communicated, but not wisdom. One can find it, live it, do wonders through it, but one cannot communicate and teach it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;👆🏽 That is why I ask you read these books and discover it yourself. It is a pretty small book and easy to read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Design Methods — J. Christopher Jones&lt;br /&gt;
The perfect design methods to get you unstuck. Forget Design Thinking, this is pure gold. The library has a heavily contested copy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Elements of style — Zinser&lt;br /&gt;
Excellent book to keep handy while writing reports. I am grateful to my guide, Prof. Girish to have recommended it back then.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every Tool’s a Hammer: Life Is What You Make It — Adam Savage &lt;br /&gt;
If you are product designer or build anything physical, please do not graduate without reading this. Adam Savage, is one of the Mythbusters (TV Show). He has been an inspiration for me and got me excited about making and crafting things. In this book, he condenses his cognitive processes and talk about various hacks and stories from his time at ILM and beyond. It will make you feel good. Trust me !&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“It doesn’t matter if you’re a model maker, a potter, a dancer, a programmer, a writer, a political activist, a teacher, a musician, a milliner, whatever. It’s all the same. Making is making, and none of it is failure.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Brave New World — Aldous Huxley&lt;br /&gt;
A classic to read and reflect. Get a class buddy to read it with and then talk over some chai or whatever you people are drinking now ;)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Technopoly - Neil Postman &lt;br /&gt;
As the nature of design industry in India (and maybe globally) is very technology driven, it is important to avoid getting too stuck with what technology ‘can’ do and rather how technology can be used as a tool. Design is not problem solving and please don’t get too enamored by that new tech thing. This book can help you by providing a counter opinion and balance your influences.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Candide — Voltaire &lt;br /&gt;
Probably shorter than this blog post. Please do read it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Show Your Work — Austin Kleon&lt;br /&gt;
Showing your work in very important. Keep things under wrap is not a good idea .  This book can be a great guide to get out there with your work. Writing is a great tool to think. Many of my friends did get new ideas when the wrote their reports. Please do read this book. Another thing to do could be to start making a portfolio way earlier than you sit for placements/apply for jobs. Ideally six months early. 
Putting a blog up is very easy. It is even easier if you don’t know how to code. Use tools like webflow to get your things out and presentable to general public. Seek critical feedback from strangers and internet beings. (Reddit🤭)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Antifragile - Nassim Taleb &lt;br /&gt;
My friend, Paco, suggested this to me. This book is a dense one. I took about 4 months to read it. But I am a terrible reader so don’t trust me on time. The book teaches a ton of lessons around idea of antifragility. Most natural systems tend to be antifragile i.e when the stressor is removed they come out better than before. It a great book to read when living in times of uncertainties (like near your jury 😜) and provides various cognitive tool to understand and reflect on what happens around you.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Antifragility is beyond resilience or robustness. The resilient resists shocks and stays the same; the antifragile gets better.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Design Is a Job - Mike Monterio &lt;br /&gt;
Ok. So, you are passionate about design. You got a job as a designer. And it is a company that starts with M, A, G or B. Wow. Must be great. The salary is amazing 🤑. You are stoked. 🙀
On top of that, You give everything to get things out. You are good. But sadly, the world is not always. This book helps you develop the skin, hard skin, especially if you freelance or run your own shop. I wish I had read it earlier. 🥲 
&lt;br /&gt;Mike writes very well for designers. Do check him out on Medium. His series, ‘Dear Designer’ will help you develop some criticality.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Spectacle Society — Guy Debord&lt;br /&gt;
Not the last book, but a good one. Guy is one of the early situationists. This book provides a thought provoking insight into the current world mediated by images and what truly is behind these images. If it is too heavy, you can also watch the youtube video documentary of the same &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/60328678&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. If these things interest you, be sure to check out works by McLuhan, Baudrillard, and Lacan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The spectacle is not a collection of images, but a social relation among people, mediated by images.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some other books that is worth taking a look at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extra :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wabi Sabi — Leonard Cohen&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;44 letters from a liquid modern world — Zigmut Bauman&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Shaping Things — Bruce Sterling&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Amusing ourselves to death — Neil Postman&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How to Walk — T.N. Hann&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the new tweet ritual : &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Dear Designer,&lt;br /&gt;Make diverse friends.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Rohit Gupta (@rohit7gupta) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/rohit7gupta/status/1341431304429170710?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;December 22, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;(I literally had to google the date to name this file. It is 2021 and not 2020. 🤭)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello all,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I dearly apologize for the delay in maintaining this piece of internet that I own. I have been a bad gardener and my flowers have wilted. Thanks to all those who came by in the past year to see things here. There is nothing to complain about for my absence. But, I will try to write more regularly in any case. This post describes what I have been up to for the past 2 years and my plans to keep this garden running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;where-this-blog-is-headed&quot;&gt;Where this blog is headed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;style&quot;&gt;Style&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I plan to write shorter and more structure content, in general. The attention spans are on a drop and I tend to get carried away (Like I was about to .. ).  I will still keep the informal style as that who I am as a person. My english writing skills are a bit rusty so that might some oiling as well. (totally forgot the ‘need’)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of graphics and hand-drawn imagery are planned to be introduced soon. (That is how coat people talk)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best of all, I will try experimenting writing in Spanish from Spain as well. Usually super short articles to get a hang of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, some emoji, memes, and gif garnish is included.
&lt;img src=&quot;https://static.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5ece0a3116bf0_5nioqb03cp051-png__700.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;content&quot;&gt;Content&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rants, Rants and many more rants. Just kidding. The topics, I plan to cover are :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Creative Technology ― My usual hacks on getting things to talk to each other, crawler keywords : IoT, Processing, OSC, Generative Design, p5js, Web Development  etc&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Critical Technology ―  Using technology as a medium to critique our human condition. Usually being reflective about things and using tech to express that. It involves use/abuse/misuse of technology. &lt;a href=&quot;http://rohitg.in/equal/&quot;&gt;This project&lt;/a&gt; is an example.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Electronics ❤️ ― How to do this, blah..blah posts. Plus, 🥁, I have my own 3D printer now. So, something here and there&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reflections ― Usually about immigration, (de)colonization, design, thinking and post-modernity, Slavoj Žižek etc. I see things, I do things, Gotta be reflective about it, innit?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Poems ― Oh yes, sad stuff. But ya’ll are getting them. I usually ‘bundle’ a visual with my poems now like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/CHtSyxwK1EJ/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Art  ― &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hicetnunc.xyz/tz/tz1WoP8aviKa6jgFnjKYnRjtYq3DHcxS9hZ6&quot;&gt;NFTs&lt;/a&gt; and not so NFT&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;technology-stack&quot;&gt;Technology stack&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its a bummer. I am using Jekyll. Its good but I miss hot reloads and publishing on the go. So, my plan is :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Try to move to a headless CMS that uses GraphQL and markdown. I love JAMstack. It appeals to the person inside me. Currently testing things out with GraphCMS.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Redesign the page templates probably using tailwind and/or webflow.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use Nuxt.js and deploy on Netlify using some CI/CD from Github.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Homogenize with my &lt;a href=&quot;http://rohitg.in/portfolio/&quot;&gt;portfolio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Keep writing here until then.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;frequency&quot;&gt;Frequency&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets skip this. But, I will try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-have-i-been-doing&quot;&gt;How have I been doing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;… mostly losing hair, and&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;professionally&quot;&gt;Professionally&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I completed my internship and diploma at IED Madrid. I was grateful to have met so many cool people during that time. The way design is taught here and in India is a bit different. I am happy to have experienced that. Maybe, I will write about it someday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After my master, I decided to stay. But, the nature of the world, if you may say, does not allow that. You,a foreigner from a not-allowed country, cannot just decide to stay. Thankfully, my university helped and gave me a few months to get an extension filed and look for work. I eventually applied for 317 jobs and wrote 53 cover letters and appeared for 7-8 interviews. I was willing to work where I will do ‘my-kind-of’ work and not ‘their-kind-of’ work. Having learned this long time back and some parting tips from my design prof.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a bit tough. But I kept being rejected,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;either due to lack of experience (I had about 2 years of professional exp and 5 years if they consider my startup), or&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;or Skillset mismatch (‘How can one apply for an Experience Design position and not have designed apps?’)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;or effort/uncertainty required on the company’s side to do paperwork for me (My friends in the US, Europe is a different ball game. Not sure exactly why though.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Or due to both (Companies don’t usually hire a less experienced person from abroad. However, they do overestimate the organizational effort to do so. Let me know, if I can help.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, after some frank calls with recruiters who asked me that it could be difficult as they have never recruited like that in Spain. I was pretty much in ruins. I remember sitting in &lt;em&gt;Casa de campo&lt;/em&gt; nearby the &lt;em&gt;lago&lt;/em&gt; and ruminating sadly. I then started applying to China as they are the center of what I call ‘downstream innovation’ (I should write about this lens of looking sometime). There was some interest but then maybe I was not so sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also started applying, but more strategically in EU. I got my work reviewed from friends and strangers on reddit who helped me zero in on the profiles. One day, when I was on a bus back from an interview, my buddy, Gustav, said that this cool company — Propelland was looking for someone. I checked the post and sent Sid, the co-founder, a message who asked me to apply right away. I got interviewed a few times and eventually got an internship. The team was amazing and very kind. I was client calling few days before I joined. They, however, still did not knew, how to hire a non EU foreigner, but were willing to take the leap of faith. After months of talking to other friends I was able to find good lawyers and managed to collect about 200 sheets of papers from India (Delhi, Pune, Mumbai) and Spain (Madrid, Barcelona).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then after 10 months of applying, I got a VISA to work for about 2 years (about 6 months late due to CoVID ). So, yeah. I work at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propelland.com/&quot;&gt;Propelland&lt;/a&gt; in Spain as a designer and technologist. I spend days designing and building prototypes. Thanks to everyone who helped me and I am very grateful. The whole company is as big as my team in the last company (30 ppl tops) and I know all of them (unless someone joined last night). Its a big family. I work with cool and humble people based across 3 continents. We are also hiring in US and Mexico. So, lemme know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;emotionally&quot;&gt;Emotionally&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Thanks for sticking till here&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frankly, it has been very hard. I seem to be living at the edge, both as a person and sometimes even in terms of means. There has been this feeling of compression. I felt so compressed and mutated. It has been like going through a trauma. People in power underestimate the emotional cost a person has to pay to do things. I felt the whole process felt way harder than it seemed and drained me. I was entirely ignorant and being rational was painful. Plus, not many people really understand this. So much so, that when I got the permission to work, I was not really happy. Over the time,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the endless wait to get your paperwork&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the passive racism and uncomfortable stares&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a terrible end to ‘something’&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;unending attempts to make friends and feel a part of the group&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;CoVID&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;had lead to the erosion of myself. The annihilation of self leads to another rootless-manufactured self (very dialectical). There were several hidden breakdowns. I felt I needed some help to emotionally restructure myself rather keep iterating. Thankfully and gratefully, the few people I talk to were very receptive and helped me through it. It is hard, but I guess, that is what I signed up for. Things are better now and hence, I write. 🥳&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would not really recommend someone going through this. 
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The bubble of a tech-worker my other friends abroad seem to live in a safer option than my bubble (in this bubble world 💬). But, I don’t value that personally as it is not intriguing enough. Plus, stoicism man! and also Mr. Taleb’s Anti-fragility are cool concepts to think about.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Also this guy on the street had something to say.

It is 2021 and not 2020. 🤭) Hello all, I dearly apologize for the delay in maintaining this piece of internet that I own. I have been a bad gardener and my flowers have wilted. Thanks to all those who came by in the past year to see things here. There is nothing to complain about for my absence. But, I will try to write more regularly in any case. This post describes what I have been up to for the past 2 years and my plans to keep this garden running.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1390624137l/2034402.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1390624137l/2034402.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Suggested reading list for Masters students at IDC -I</title><link href="http://rohitg.in/2019/03/31/BookRecs1/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Suggested reading list for Masters students at IDC -I" /><published>2019-03-31T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2019-03-31T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://rohitg.in/2019/03/31/BookRecs1</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://rohitg.in/2019/03/31/BookRecs1/">&lt;p&gt;It has been almost an year. I have been out of IDC and working/studying here in Spain. As I continue to explore design, I often read books that I feel could answer many questions I had. I hope students still have a lot of questions. In this brief post, I present a collection of books I came across that could help design students perceive design better. I hope they keep you well insulated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The list is arranged in order of possible things you could have in mind at a particular time in the course. So, I have structured them semester wise. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Malay, Chinmay, Rishabh, and Advait for their contributions and suggestions. Thanks to Prof. Girish, who named some of these books in conversations.
This is the Part I, Part II comes in a week or so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;semester-i&quot;&gt;Semester I&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you were like me and read very little. It would be a good time to get started. This is also the time when you were asked to think about the definition of design. Is there one? Why should we define it?  The books I would say you could read are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Old Man and the Sea— Ernest Hemingway&lt;br /&gt;
I am not joking. This book is a treat and in sometime who would relate to the old man in this sea. The line length is short and it is a nice beginner book.  Read it in a week or so.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thoughts on Design — Paul Rand&lt;br /&gt;
Another short book by Paul Rand on his works on design. He covers parts of his learnings mostly from a graphic design perspective. I like the part where he discusses the role of symbols to convey messages. It is a short book and could take a week. But take your time.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;He says,&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“The designer is primarily confronted with three classes of material: a) the given material: product, copy, slogan, logotype, format, media, production process; b) the formal material: space, contrast, proportion, harmony, rhythm, repetition, line, mass, shape, color, weight, volume, value, texture; c) the psychological material: visual perception and optical illusion problems, the spectators’ instincts, intuitions, and emotions as well as the designer’s own needs.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Vignelli cannon — Massimo Vignelli &lt;br /&gt;
The master whose graphic &amp;amp; product design speaks for it. He presents his ideas in probably the most condensed manner as well. You would hear words like Syntactic, Semantics and Pragmatics in the book and the course. It could help you make sense of the job of the designer. His tricks on using space, font and typography are superb.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“Design without discipline is anarchy, an exercise of irresponsibility.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Design of everyday things — Don Norman &lt;br /&gt;
Probably a lot of people who you talk to have already read this. So, you can discuss on the topics in the book and maybe make new friends. He talks about affordances and design in a very approachable way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;longer-reads&quot;&gt;Longer Reads&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sapiens — Yuval Noah Harari&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Sapiens is an amazing book to get a sense of world we are living in. It makes you very curious and you could start seeing patterns in daily life. I like the part where he talks about agriculture and how power flows in the society.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Places to read : It would probably be raining when you start. I would go to Jalvihar and read there by the stairs (if it is not raining) or if you get a nice hostel room facing the lake, you are covered. If you prefer the nights, IDC is the best place if PD guys do not have any assignment to do.  If you prefer going outside campus, got to marine drive by train or cycle, near the restaurant— Pizza by the bay. Nice views and a good book. I am saying too much maybe, but you can buy some books around Flora Fountain, used or otherwise. In winters, Gullu and Descafe are nice places. Cutting, Vada Pao, and Entropy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;semester-2&quot;&gt;Semester 2&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, it is the second semester. You are already confused. Too many whys? There seems to be a dissonance between the perceived and the expected. The dream of cool jobs, sassy (why did I use this word) workplaces, you becoming the next Mistry have slowly started to become real. You are excited. Design seems amazing or maybe routine. But maybe you could think a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Animal Farm— George Orwell&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Classic short novella by Orwell. Super fun to read when watching politics debates on TV. The satire is very sharp. If you project the book’s events, you can feel a bit uncomfortable about the current state of polity which shows some similar features since 1945. The novella was written to critique the politics around Russian Revolution.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“The creatures outside looked from pig to man, and from man to pig, and from pig to man again; but already it was impossible to saywhich was which.”
“All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sapiens — Yuval Noah Harari&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;If you didn’t read it last semester, you should read it now. If you read it, read Homo Deus.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lateral Thinking (with friends)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This is a classic gem. I think many people may have read it, but it is quite helpful to read as a designer. I feel, as a designer it all boils down to ultimately finding connections in a problem space and then creating these “artefacts” to probe the connection and see what works. This book could be helpful. Debono’s - Six thinking hats is a good next book for ideation process.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The way this book is written is probably meant for educators. The style is like a workbook. I always wanted to work through this book with friends. If you can convince friends to read it together, may be you could have a group and meet once a while to do exercises from the book.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Designing Design — Keyna Hara (MUJI)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The physicality of this book, the paper, the layout and the content all are simply amazing. Kenya Hara is the art-director at Muji. You can almost feel the Mujiness of this book. He shows samples from his work that put forward his way of thinking about design. I like the tactile experience  of his products and packaging like the fruit containers. This book inspired me to visit Tokyo by participating in Yahoo !  HackU (with Rishabh). We did visit the Muji flagship in Ginza.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Art is an expression of an individual’s will to society at large, one 
whose origin is very much of a personal nature. Design, on the other 
hand, is basically not self-expression. Instead, it originates in 
society. The essence of design lies in the process of discovering a 
problem shared by many people and trying to solve it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The book is waiting for you in central library.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Catcher in the Rye— JD Salinger&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;There are books and all. There is prose and all. It narrates the events from the three days Holden spent in New York after escaping from his hostel in Penn. I like the way the book is written. It feel like just a transcribed story you heard from someone at a cafe. It has no message , nothing. It just tries to bring out interesting things that could happen in a banal world and all.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;“I’d just be the catcher in the rye and all. I know it’s crazy, but 
that’s the only thing I’d really like to be. I know it’s crazy.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Designerly ways of knowing — Nigel Cross&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;If you were interested what designers do, what is design, what is the difference between design, and art and science? Or if you are troubled that you could end up/ended up making UIs that just do something, and want to know if that is design? Read this book. It was suggested by Prof. Rao in a Design Research module. This book has the ability to make you think about the practise of design especially if you come from either exact science — Engineers or inexact sciences — Fine Arts.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Resolve ill-defined problems&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;adopt solution-focussing strategies&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;employ abductive/productive/appositional thinking&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;use non-verbal, graphical/spatial modeling media&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;“We are like that only” — Rama Bijapurkar*&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Suggested by Chinmay, It talks about the Indian context from a more market perspective but has many hidden gems that tell you about why we, as Indians, work like that and make such choices. It could help designers think about the social and cognitive environment their products could operate.  It gives you “real” idea who India users might be. This is a fix to a classic design pitfall. If we design for people similar to us, we kind of assume a lot. 
I would rant and say, I did try reading the book but it needs some courage to read the same things again and again. But, Do you accept the challenge?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;1984 — George Orwell&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Classic Orwellian Dystopia Novel. Watch out for Newspeak. Did you find some newspeak around you? If you have already read it, “Brave New World” by Huxley. What future do you think is happening?  Or are both ?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Change by Design — Tim Brown&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;It is a rather inspiring book on the impact of design. I read it before coming to IDC. It talks about the projects by IDEO. The book is more like a feel good narrative about the impact of design. It does not have a lot of design methods in it. But, yeah makes you feel good and strengthens your belief in power of design.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Get a blog &lt;br /&gt;
All reading and no writing makes Jack depressed. It is a good time to start writing what you feel about the work you see and do. I could be a weekly reflection or documentation of a project you do. Places you can make one is Medium (more people with read it there), Github pages (like this one) or Netlify (New kid on the block).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;longer-reads-1&quot;&gt;Longer Reads&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thinking Fast and Slow — Daniel Kahneman
Malay recommends it to expose you to “a behavioural angle to design”. It  is written by Nobel Prize winning economist. It could give to a nice peek into how people make decisions. This book is one of the most popular books on topics like behaviour change, behavioural economics, and social psychology.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;79 Essays on Design — Michael Bierut
Another recommendation by our bookworm friend, Malay. The book is a collection of essays and reflections by Michael Bierut. Mr. Bierut was a student of Massimo Vignelli and is with Pentagram now. His work and process are amazing. Check out his new world symphony logo. Malay further recommends reading one essay a day for the faint hearted like me.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Places to read : The weather gets amazing in this sem.  Go to Gullu, Sit near the lake, Sameer hill, IDC at night or Hostel Roof. Carry a cup of tea.&lt;/p&gt;

It does that by converting a menu to a linguistic model and then computationally generating new food dishes using Probabilistic Context-free grammar (PCFG).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, the menu is interpreted as a language and a new dish is just another sentence, a meaningful combination of words. So, if you teach it the Chinese menu and south Indian menu, it generates things like schezwan idli with egg fried rice. These combinations are essentially possible as they are made by understanding the morphology of the menu system. This project helped me look at the food menus as languages and languages as a group of morphological combinations driven by adopted norms.
&lt;!--more--&gt;
It must be noted that the generated combinations are valid extensions of the original menu and not entirely random. Hence, the project generates a missingMenu .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made it initially when I was a student at IIT-IDC and was curious how our tiny hostel cafés have a 5-page menus with so little ingredients on the cooking shelf. It made me curious about how these menus are generated. Remember the center fresh advert boasting about menus at a restaurant?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/9LkIFhc3ZkQ?start=25&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, one weekend, I asked my friend, Angela, to get me the menu of a hostel in IIT i.e. H10. I wrote the dishes on a piece of paper and started breaking them. These chunks would essentially make up the language I will use in my context-free grammar program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/hdGbwjL.jpg?1&quot; alt=&quot;Scribbles&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key points from my analysis are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The menu results in a graph like structure. Several dishes were constructed just as a fusion from another cuisine. Schezwan Noodles made schezwan dosa&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There were a few ingredients like Cheese, Egg, Chicken, and Schezwan which produced maximum divergence to the core dishes. They resulted in about 4! (4x3x2x1) multiplication to dishes. Like Fried Noodles, Egg Fried Noodles, Schezwan Egg Fried Noodles, Schezwan Chicken Noodles, Schezwan Dosa, Schezwan Cheese Dosa, Triple Rice which is kind of like Noodle + Rice. etc. I call them Maximizers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Within the same cusine category, you have three Multipliers. These can be things like Plain (Lack of a multiplier), Veg, Egg, Chicken, and sometimes Masala. So, for South Indian food, we have Plain Dosa, Masala Dosa and that makes it possible to make Egg Dosa (Egg is a multiplier from Chinese Food Category — Obviously sold in Maddu Mess).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So essentially :
Maggi (a cuisine in its own) has plain Maggi&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using Maximizers: Cheese Maggi, Schezwan Maggi, Egg Maggi, Egg Cheese Maggi, Schezwan Egg Maggi&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using Multipliers: Masala Maggi&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using both: Masala Egg Maggi&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea was to represent this system of Multipliers and Maximizers as a language and then generate possible combinations using this language model.
A start phrase would be like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You &lt;em&gt;hedge&lt;/em&gt; have &lt;em&gt;dishOne&lt;/em&gt; with &lt;em&gt;SideDish&lt;/em&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Hostel&lt;/em&gt; and drink &lt;em&gt;liquid&lt;/em&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, a possible iteration could be :
You &lt;strong&gt;could&lt;/strong&gt; have &lt;strong&gt;Shezwan Bhindi Fry&lt;/strong&gt; with &lt;strong&gt;Plain Rice&lt;/strong&gt; at &lt;strong&gt;H6&lt;/strong&gt; and drink &lt;strong&gt;Chocolate milk shake&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIPEvh8HbGQ&quot;&gt;Dan Shifmann’s instructions&lt;/a&gt; on using &lt;a href=&quot;https://rednoise.org/rita/index.php&quot;&gt;RiTA&lt;/a&gt; as a PCFG generator and wrote a model based on the discussion presented above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;visual-design&quot;&gt;Visual Design&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the logic was working, it was time to give it a decent aesthetic vehicle. 🚗&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I chose a simple layout and designed a few iterations of the UI in Figma. I played with various colors that remind me of food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/uTj7VDE.png&quot; alt=&quot;Imgur&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final color palette was derived from an image of Vada Pao. I love Vada Pao.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I experimented with using CSS grids to layout the page. It was a challenge to translate things from UI to a working interface. The code generated by Figma is helpful but not dependable. So, I had to play around a lot. The cool part was making those magical underlines and follow Web accessibility guides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.imgur.com/rzDWfcC.png&quot; alt=&quot;Imgur&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final project is hosted &lt;a href=&quot;http://rohitg.in/missingMenu/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Do check it out and provide feedback. If you are in IIT Bombay, give it a try and let me know. Some beta-testers found it interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through this project, I tried to scratch the surface of the field of computational linguistics. I am curious what other linguistic artefacts can be understood in these terms. The actual menu at the restaurant is probably a more constrained/time-tested output of these combinations, but through this tool, we can loosen the norms and try new things by generating a possible menu. Maybe you find your next favourite dish? Let me know :)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Medical Certificate&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Documents of existence : Birth Certificate, Degrees, PAN Card&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Documents of economic validity: Loan papers, Bank statements, Income tax return, PAN Card&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Apostille of Hague stamp on PCC and Medical certificate&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Photocopy of all pages in passport&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cover Letter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pre-requisite Skills:&lt;/em&gt;
Good purpose of going to Spain, patience, support from university, and time management&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Process&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When you get acceptance, leave everything and just call &lt;a href=&quot;https://india.blsspainvisa.com/national_visa.php&quot;&gt;these guys&lt;/a&gt; on 0124-4556710. Book an appointment. It will usually be like 1-3 months ahead but that is why this is the first step. The whole process of getting other documents will take about 20 days. So, book the date accordingly.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Send mail to the university to post/courier all documents on their letter head in Spanish, signed and stamped. They should be in the university envelope.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now dust off the passport and see if it is valid and then get ready to get a PCC. PCC is a document that just does the Police verification part of passport issuance once more and makes sure you stay where you say you stay and there are no criminal cases against you.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Book appointment at &lt;a href=&quot;https://portal2.passportindia.gov.in/AppOnlineProject/online/pccOnlineApp&quot;&gt;PSK&lt;/a&gt; and pay online .&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Go to PSK with &lt;a href=&quot;https://portal2.passportindia.gov.in/AppOnlineProject/docAdvisor/pccPassport&quot;&gt;required documents&lt;/a&gt; like your original passport and adhaar card&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Submit docs and do whatever they ask.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Wait for police visit&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Be at home when police comes&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Keep a Adhaar copy ready&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Wait for the SMS from PSK to collect PCC (5-10 days)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Go and get PCC- 2 copies, signed by passport officer&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Go to the doctor and get yourself checked up. If doctor is satisfied, ask him to give a medical certificate on his letter pad with his registration number, name, address and phone visible. It should have this line, exactly -&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;__&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;__&lt;/strong&gt;_ is not suffering from any disease that can have repercussions any on the public health in accordance with the International Sanitary Act 2005.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wait for PCC and in the meantime, you can start filling the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.exteriores.gob.es/Embajadas/NUEVADELHI/es/InformacionParaExtranjeros/Documents/Application%20for%20National%20Visa%20-%20English.pdf&quot;&gt;National VISA form&lt;/a&gt;. The instructions are given &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.exteriores.gob.es/Embajadas/NUEVADELHI/es/InformacionParaExtranjeros/Documents/study%20visa-for%20duration%20more%20than%20180%20days.pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; as well .&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Your PCC has arrived and you have the medical certificate. It is now time to get Apostille stamps. Most people may forget this step altogether. This is the most monetized process by agents and hence, prices vary from 4000 - 2000 INR. I read the guidelines and figured out it should not cost more than 1500 INR. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostille_Convention&quot;&gt;Apostille&lt;/a&gt; is basically making your documents valid in countries who are on the convention. It is like VISA for your documents or international notary. I got it done from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/place/IVS+Global+Service+Pvt.Ltd/@28.629057,77.2248241,19.25z/data=!4m12!1m6!3m5!1s0x390cfd33da02b2a3:0x9fb1599471f60cb7!2sBarakhamba+Metro+Station!8m2!3d28.6293547!4d77.225295!3m4!1s0x390cfd33e855a343:0x42afeaeaa35caad8!8m2!3d28.628857!4d77.2247069&quot;&gt;shop&lt;/a&gt; in Arunachal Bhavan in Barakhamba Road. I found the place while I had a long discussion with another agent who was charging a lot and I just walked around and found it on Google Maps. He takes a day to do everything. There is a coffee shop nearby. Do not drink coffee there, its very bad.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now you should have docs from university, Apostille (PCC, Medical Certificate), Appointment email printout, National Visa form filled with blue pen and photo stuck on it. Now it is time to spend some more money and know about it.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Buy an travel insurance policy of value more than $30,000. I prefer policybazaar . (15 mins)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Get a DD/Banker’s Cheque made &lt;em&gt;physically&lt;/em&gt; in the branch of your choice (3-4 hours)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Get bank statements and Income Tax return (1-2 days)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;You should be able to prove that you have enough money to stay in Spain apart from the university fee. It is around 450 EUR/month. I feel this is better than the german approach of opening up a block account.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fill the VISA form completely and get it checked by a well meaning friend. Photocopy everything. Forget about saving paper at the moment. Put in a glimpse of your CV as well, to redundantly prove your eligibility to the VISA.  PS: You do not need translations of documents for student visa process. It is now exempted. I have saved you 5000 INR at this step and about 7000 INR in total now. Say thanks by telling others as well :)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Carry all documents you have ever produced with you to the consulate. They can sometimes ask, its normal. Do not forget writing a cover letter explaining your state and purpose. To be super-nice, arrange all documents in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.exteriores.gob.es/Embajadas/NUEVADELHI/es/InformacionParaExtranjeros/Documents/study%20visa-for%20duration%20more%20than%20180%20days.pdf&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; order. Be prepared to wait in a queue and face Indians already looking at you in an alienated sense. Get used to the feeling. Absorb it. Ignore it and act in an opposite way. The guards will help you. They are the kindest folks. If it is humid, carry water and some mosquito repellent gel.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Enter the embassy and wait for your turn. As you wait, reflect on the reasons to go to Spain. Now, when your turn it is, be honest and confident. They will take your passport and call/email you in a month. Keep the counter copy of the form safely.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;After a month, go to the embassy. They ask you to come once in the morning to see your face. Then they call you again in 3-4 hours. I wish I could write “why” somewhere. Now, come again after loitering in CP, if you can watch a play or two, and then you get your VISA.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Precautions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Never trust any agent. National VISA is issued by the embassy only.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get Apostille from a recognized place only. Like all things in life, there are fake stamps too.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Carry all documents, you miss something and then you may miss the appointment.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Try meditation everyday.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Observations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this experiment, we observed that in-spite of the seemingly easy way to get a VISA, it is not very easy. The VISA guidelines do not seem to be very clear on ground. The problem is not by the embassy but the diverse range of information stimuli the user experiences.  The experimenters observed that a positive result is possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Result&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through proper grit and determination, one can get National Visa to do internship in Spain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope it helps! Wishing luck :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers,&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This post presents my reflections on the design education I received at IDC. The views presented here are mine. 
Caution: May contain rants.
TL;DR, - There is no TL,DR in Design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;why-design&quot;&gt;Why design?&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After my graduation in Electrical Engineering and partly in Electronics (from CEDT), I had joined Tata Motors, RnD at &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/04/12/NoobsGuide/&quot;&gt;Pune&lt;/a&gt;. My role was with the HMI group there. We worked on various things like control panels and their evaluation (subjective and objective), setting standards for various features, designing, implementing and strategies for various car features like Acoustics, PEPS, Infotainment, Apps, and Telemetry. If someone is familiar with the automotive industry, the organization structure at TML is similar to Ford or JLR. So, in technical terms, I was a part of PAT and ODT. In general, our group was the “internal customer” of the organization. Hence, we set targets for various things and design strategies to be implemented. These would go to the engineers/designers who would implement it based on our &lt;!--more--&gt; requirements. Then, we would test these systems objectively and subjectively and give a  Go-NoGo signal to the management. The range of exposure was huge. We dealt with things like tiny icons on the front fascia to larger transmission systems in the car. I think the work there, triggered a lot of inner aspirations and complemented my understanding as an &lt;em&gt;engineer&lt;/em&gt;. I developed an interest in minor details of things like the feedback of a button, the volume of the buzzer, the color of the screen under various lighting conditions, acoustics of the car and engine music. I thank my team and friends at TML - Vinit Sir, Priyanka, Mihir, Sachin, and Prem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At TML, I worked on infotainment navigation systems for Bolt and Tiago/Tigor, then on acoustic measurement and audio-tuning and finally on the ConnectNeXt app ecosystem. We interacted with lots of people from various companies/institutes as we involved them in our work. The work was nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from TML, I (as always, unfortunately) had a keen interest in “making”. The moment I reached Pune, In a few days, I was at &lt;a href=&quot;/2014/10/16/MakerParty/&quot;&gt;Mozilla Makerparty&lt;/a&gt;. I still remember the pains of commuting and the fun. Thanks to that, I made good friends like Anuj, Rituparna, Nishant and Sunil Sir. We did a few collab projects together. I, Ritu and Anuj still work together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before exiting college and working with CEPD, most of my projects were essentially &lt;em&gt;self-expression&lt;/em&gt;. They were my abrupt and rapid reactions to instantaneous thoughts and desires. I did not think them thoroughly. Post CEPD, thanks to some gathered skills in electronics and organizing, I was much more confident in executing things. The expression became fun and work at CEPD. But, what about the purpose? There was none outside, having fun and spreading the love. There was no user or customer. Hence, there was no solid problem. At Pune, I grazed grasses and worked a lot, building things like speaker systems, PCBs, HAM-RX and eventually worked with Anuj on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://makerville.io/knit/&quot;&gt;Knit&lt;/a&gt;. I was under the impression that I am becoming someone, who can do things but does not know what to do. This lead to a lot of stressed times. I wanted to join &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.media.mit.edu/&quot;&gt;*&lt;/a&gt; as I found their work pretty exciting. Little did I knew, I applied and got rejected. I was very sad that day. I am just an aimless maker?. Not an X under 25 or Y under 30. Who’s who of hollowness? Nosy talker at conventions. I did incinerate some silicon, for sure. I got over with that in time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At work too, I realized that there could be a knowledge gap in my understanding of the design elements. I can feel the things to some extent, but to decipher the cause and fix it was challenging. I wanted to learn more about this. I was just not doing justice to the task. Therefore, I decided to try and pursue the higher education thread, rather than switching jobs . I researched about some courses abroad and in India that would help me understand the field better. After a lot of thought, I decided to probably do a degree in design as the curriculum and approach resonated with me. I did validate my interest in design by taking the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.edx.org/course/product-design-the-delft-design-approach&quot;&gt;Delft Design course&lt;/a&gt; on edX. Even though it may not be an exhaustive representation of the design pedagogy, It may help me understand if it is for me or not. I really liked the course and hence, zeroed in on design as a future course. I applied to the two best colleges in India, NID and IIT-IDC, very selectively. I got through both and chose IDC. The reason, without being drawn into discussions on pedagogy, was exposure. I felt IDC would provide me with better view of both research and design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I may have been biased because - It was IIT, so I could meet more geeks; I met a geek prof in the interview at IDC, who could see through my work; The IDC website had better information on things. Now, what did I expect?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wished to :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Develop design sensitivities&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Explore my interests in HCI through electronics, creative coding etc&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Work on good projects and meet inspiring folks&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do as much work as possible&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Develop thinking skills in terms of finding and understanding problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;what-is-design-circa-2016&quot;&gt;What is design? circa 2016&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I came at IDC in 2016, I felt that design is essentially &lt;em&gt;out of the box, problem-solving&lt;/em&gt; . I recall, most of the &lt;em&gt;engineers&lt;/em&gt; replied something similar at the orientation. The dominant voices said things like &lt;em&gt;aesthetics&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;visual&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;functional&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;User-centric&lt;/em&gt; and other similar ideas. Henceforth, I worked on my understanding of design.
However,to what extent does the problem get solved ? The idea of affecting a problem and not essentially solving it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;perceived-changes-in-thinking-and-learnings&quot;&gt;Perceived changes in thinking and learnings?&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this section, I summarize the changes in me that I noticed after doing the masters. To understand them, I have been carefully analysing my previous work, conversations with friends and visiting undergrad college. A little nostalgia helps. It took me about a month to come to this list and I stopped expanding when points started repeating and forming themes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Questioning the premise&lt;/strong&gt; - I think this is the most dominant change of all. As students and kids, we are made to forget the premise. In mathematics and science, the problems and values of variables are given. Engineering expects that we design the circuits we are asked to. But who would ask, &lt;em&gt;WHY?&lt;/em&gt;. The most important 3 characters. Many of my engineering folks, still act like this. This habit is a good thinking strategy and often results in &lt;em&gt;non-band aid&lt;/em&gt; type paths. It helps one understand the context. It has been a good addition, but with a few negatives- like I don’t usually make random things these days as I used to enjoy, there are lots of discussions/arguments when you question the premise in a social setting, some friends may not be very comfortable to get the answers like “ Why do you even need it?”.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;System level thinking&lt;/strong&gt; - Systems are always taught to you as an engineer, but your position, ridiculed by the industry, is to seldom think in its terms. Design teaches you a macroscopic view of thinking followed by microscopic analysis. As &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.idc.iitb.ac.in/sumant/index.html&quot;&gt;Prof. Sumant&lt;/a&gt; says, mile wide and inch deep and then inch wide and mile deep. Nature is a system. Things are interconnected and affect each other. If one “makes” a thing/intervention, its effect is usually not localized. It impacts the whole system and hence, a designer has to work on all these facets of a problem. I did not use to think like this as most engineers often work on a small part of the problem has hence, may not think in these terms.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mindfulness&lt;/strong&gt; - Although mindfulness may seem to be a recurring keyword in self-help books. But design teaches you to be a lot mindful than you would normally be. One has to always check one’s choices against relevant biases. This is another “why?” that I ask myself. “Why?” am I reacting this way?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Endlessness of the problem&lt;/strong&gt; - Design problems are often different than engineering ones. This is the nature of design. Design never ends. It seems like a loop that slows down when the user’s expectations have met for the time being. A change in the state, calls for a designerly response and the loop restarts. This phenomenon is rare in engineering unless there is a designer involved.&lt;br /&gt;
I recall it from &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/05/04/PinchPhone/&quot;&gt;my latest project&lt;/a&gt;. After about two iterations, the toy was given to the users for evaluation. I am currently working on the third version as user’s expectation has now increased from the time of showing the prototype. This is a great thing for a designer. If the user, is able to see the problem through my solution, one of the goals of design has achieved. His suggestions will improve the product in the longer run. The aim is to have the best solution to the problem in a predictable span of time. The way to reach that particular stage is often complex as the problem itself is complex.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Openness of pedagogy&lt;/strong&gt; - Design education, as experienced by me, is a lot different from technical education in the past. It is more exploratory in nature and not confined to a single track. Hence, I feel, it tries to expose an aspiring designer to various sensitivities. They would not mistake things like type, color,grids etc as simple elements rather take a conscious call on each and every aspect of it. Further, design (and design research) draws heavily from practices of different fields like sociology, psychology, art studies, media ecology and others. There is a curriculum, but fundamentally, its purpose is to channel the discussion. Design tries to inculcate a “lifelong learning” approach. The discussions with teachers are informal and wide-ranging. This was quite different from my BTech days.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More than you can do?&lt;/strong&gt; - This was the hardest lesson for me to learn. I almost spent the first 7-8 months trying to overcome this bias of choosing electronics as a &lt;em&gt;material&lt;/em&gt; to realize the solution of problems. I would think, can I make a circuit that would solve this problem? This “circuitification” actually short-circuited my design process. I would hence, propose solutions that &lt;em&gt;I can build&lt;/em&gt; rather than ones that may be better. I had to separate the maker and engineer from the designer. Believe me, it felt like Hulk :P.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel that one tends to think in terms of one’s tools. It may lead to what &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_McLuhan&quot;&gt;McLuhan&lt;/a&gt; says &lt;em&gt;Rear View Mirror Thinking&lt;/em&gt;. When one imagines the newer media through the older one. Luhan would not have liked “Web pages in VR”. However, there is a satisfying rational of “building upon things you already know”. Nobody can be blamed for this tendency. Continuity is appreciated by everyone, even by the recruiter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to receive a lot of positive reinforcement when friends could see things on the table. But were they the best solutions? Maybe. I could have explored more. A wider solution space may result in a better solution. At least, it seems to be a better strategy. I am a recovering victim. Many are still there. Architects try to think of every solution in terms of spaces. Graphic designers tend to design interfaces similar to print. I think one needs to explore more. I cannot imagine the cool solutions an illustrator would bring if she/he tries to explore it from say form or electronics. We should try to take a risk and live it to the fullest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is no single solution&lt;/strong&gt; - As engineers, we have a question, which we end by answering in singularity. There is a mathematical construct involved somewhere that results in that one answer. However, design tries to solve the problem through solutions. This is because we cannot algorithmically calculate the solution to these complex problems. I love the idea and analogy of &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.media.mit.edu/2012/07/compasses-over-maps.html&quot;&gt;Compasses vs Maps&lt;/a&gt;. It says and I quote, “The idea is that in a world of massive complexity, speed, and diversity, the cost of mapping and planning details often exceeds the cost of just doing something–and the maps are often wrong.” Nigel Cross says something similar when he mentions about understanding a problem by means of possible solutions. In a ripe discussion, senior alumni once told me that his teachers had asked him to produce about 20-30 different variations of the same thing. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.christophniemann.com/&quot;&gt;Niemann&lt;/a&gt; also talks about this in his episode of Abstract. He talks about the dot exercise. I have learned this rigor to be fundamental to design practice.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Know the material&lt;/strong&gt; - In our age of rapid “prototyping”, we tend to imagine our solutions in terms of the prototyping technique. Much of the “prototyping” happens in CAD while it could very easily be made by hand. Clean hands can never make great pots. This way we cannot experience what master craftsmen does. In my time at IDC, I worked with many materials like &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/04/01/bamboo/&quot;&gt;bamboo&lt;/a&gt;, clay, thermacol, biofoam, Acrylic, styrene, PoP and finally &lt;a href=&quot;/2018/05/04/PinchPhone/&quot;&gt;wood&lt;/a&gt;. The materials teach us that true finish comes after rigor. I remember sanding the wood through 6 levels of sanding paper to achieve the finish. I thank Samarth Sir for pushing me to it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reading and Writing&lt;/strong&gt; - I am told, Good designers read a lot. Thanks to the nudges by Prof. Girish, I have tried to read as many interesting books as possible. I think I have read more books in the last two years than I did in the previous 10 years. But there are still a lot of shortcomings in my reading habit. I have to work a lot on this skill. Writing is a critical activity for designers. Design communication is an important design skill. There has been a small delta in my writing skills too. But I have a long way ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ethics and Morality&lt;/strong&gt; - The scope of the design professions has expanded beyond what many could imagine a few years back. It will not be wrong to say if, the next profession to take the Hippocratic Oath would probably be design professionals. So, much of our life is controlled via systems and interfaces we as designers design. I try to think of designs in these terms as well. The need is even more profound in the Indian context. We as designers act as proxies of the users who rely on us as people who respect their context and trust us with their privacy, data, security and sometimes lives. Designers should not absent-mindedly sugar-coat technology for mass consumption. In an important discussion during &lt;a href=&quot;http://ddsidc.com/2018/&quot;&gt;our DDS&lt;/a&gt;, Prof. Udaya kuma₹ talked about responsibility towards our country as designers. It was an important point. Our education empowers us, but we should be responsible towards our users. I did my project involving kids affected by cerebral palsy under Prof. Girish. He advised me to make multiple copies of the product so, that we can present them as a token of participation in the project. I did likewise and was happy to get very good feedback. 
If one is inclined to podcasts, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/audio/2018/mar/02/who-needs-ethics-anyway-chips-with-everything-podcast&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; talks about the need of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/90138470/design-is-inherently-an-unethical-industry&quot;&gt;ethics in design&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not being Reactionary&lt;/strong&gt;- Apart from design, one important skill that Prof. Alka taught us in her course was not being reactionary based on presented information. The media presents us with some facts focussing our attention on a particular side. We should always try and find the other side. It helps us in generating appropriate responses.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope, I have summarized the learning well. I will try to expand on them in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;influencers&quot;&gt;Influencers&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The major influencers in this journey were (including but not limited to) :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;My teachers - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.idc.iitb.ac.in/~girish/index_mr.html&quot;&gt;Prof. Girish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.idc.iitb.ac.in/ravi/&quot;&gt;Prof. Ravi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.idc.iitb.ac.in/%7Eanirudha/&quot;&gt;Prof. Anirudha&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.idc.iitb.ac.in/uaa/index.html#&quot;&gt;Prof. Attu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.agrao.in/&quot;&gt;Prof. AG Rao&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.idc.iitb.ac.in/venkat/index.html&quot;&gt;Prof. Venkat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jayeshpillai.com/&quot;&gt;Prof. Jayesh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.idc.iitb.ac.in/nishant/index.html&quot;&gt;Prof. Nishant&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.idc.iitb.ac.in/alka/index.html&quot;&gt;Prof. Alka&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://mrane.com/&quot;&gt;Prof. Mandar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;My batchmates - Malay, Udayan, Dinojh, Siva, Ankit, Shilpa, Rishabh Singh and Jain, Suyog, Dada, Vineet, Tuhin, Manasi, Manoj, Mane, Ajin, Patle, Askaswa, Amey ++&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;My seniors - Chinmay, Abhijit, Herold, Saloni, Anjana, Chandni, TallPaul, Salik&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Friends at IDC - Vajra, Shyam, Deep, Pranisha&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;what-is-design-now-circa-2018&quot;&gt;What is design now? circa 2018&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These days, the definition of design that I subscribe to is a convenient but tested combination of the definitions given in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1878856.Designerly_Ways_of_Knowing&quot;&gt;Nigel Cross’s Designerly ways of knowing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2034402.Designing_Design&quot;&gt;Kenya Harra’s Designing Design&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, Cross talks about design as the &lt;em&gt;third area&lt;/em&gt; apart from Arts and Science. He summarizes (page 20) design to comprise of abilities to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Resolve ill-defined problems&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;adopt solution-focussing strategies&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;employ abductive/productive/appositional thinking&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;use non-verbal, graphical/spatial modeling media&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Hara talks about art and design as “Art is an expression of an individual’s will to society at large, one whose origin is very much of a personal nature. Design, on the other hand, is basically not self-expression. Instead, it originates in society. The essence of design lies in the process of discovering a problem shared by many people and trying to solve it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would recommend these books to anyone interested in understanding design. They helped me a lot in the middle of the course when I felt concerned about my actions. They were recommended by Prof. Rao and Prof. Girish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I await feedback and suggestions. Please direct them to my &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:indiantinker@gmail.com&quot;&gt;mail&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers,&lt;/p&gt;

The views presented here are mine. Caution: May contain rants. TL;DR, - There is no TL,DR in Design. Why design? After my graduation in Electrical Engineering and partly in Electronics (from CEDT), I had joined Tata Motors, RnD at Pune. My role was with the HMI group there. We worked on various things like control panels and their evaluation (subjective and objective), setting standards for various features, designing, implementing and strategies for various car features like Acoustics, PEPS, Infotainment, Apps, and Telemetry. If someone is familiar with the automotive industry, the organization structure at TML is similar to Ford or JLR. So, in technical terms, I was a part of PAT and ODT. In general, our group was the “internal customer” of the organization. Hence, we set targets for various things and design strategies to be implemented. These would go to the engineers/designers who would implement it based on our</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://www.idc.iitb.ac.in/images/idc-logo_new2.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://www.idc.iitb.ac.in/images/idc-logo_new2.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Clearance Processes at IDC</title><link href="http://rohitg.in/2018/06/30/ExitIDC/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Clearance Processes at IDC" /><published>2018-06-30T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2018-06-30T00:00:00+02:00</updated><id>http://rohitg.in/2018/06/30/ExitIDC</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://rohitg.in/2018/06/30/ExitIDC/">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This post documents and encapsulates the clearance process for IDC, IIT Bombay. Hope this could reduce hassles till things go completely digital. Dedicated to the coming batches. The guide was written as an IDC student in interaction design discipline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have tried to document the informal processes that often create confusion. There is a sort of a delight you get when you get past a patch of cloudy information and when you look back, its crystal clear. Hence, one should always try to document such processes so that human race does not spend more time that one human has already spent. Neglecting the superfluous grandeur, I often imagine myself like a miner on a night shift who is underground in the tunnels. One can either temporarily secure the&lt;!--more--&gt; tunnel and take the minerals or secure it permanently so the next miner can “further” the understanding of the mine. I advise choosing the later. It makes one a “responsible” miner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IDC clearance process may seem very hard, it is tough emotionally, but it is procedurally very straightforward. The way, I optimized it was by making a dependency map that helped me prioritize things. &lt;strong&gt;Dependency Map&lt;/strong&gt; basically helps in identifying what is the relationship between various parameters like previous steps signatures, availability of staff and then come up with a sequence that minimizes redundancy of action. It is like a fishbone chart. Let us get started with your clearance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 1: Pre Jury thesis submission (skip if already done)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Things required&lt;/em&gt;: Thesis Submission form from the office, Hostel Clearance, No Dues from Accounts Section&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hostel Clearance - Ask the warden for no dues till that date. Pay via UPI on spot, email screen shot and get the signatures. You get an A5 sheet to attach with the form, or the warden may sign on the form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accounts: Write your name on a register in the Accounts section. It is in the main building. Take the stairs from the Nescafe side. It takes a day to process the slip. So, get it done in advance. 
Attach both the above with the Thesis form and get necessary signatures. Submit to the office with two copies of the report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 2: Post Jury Clearance&lt;/strong&gt;
Welcome to your P4, as it is said. With the paucity of time and this form in your hand, things might seem sad. But do not worry. This is the central goal of this post. The key is to prioritize and work on parallel independent parts.&lt;br /&gt;
The steps are :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.Collect a form from the office on time. Our office staff is very helpful. The form has three sections:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Main Clearance Certificate - IDC specific ( Front page )&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Final Clearance ( Page 2 )&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;IIT Bombay specific submissions - P2, P3&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;No dues from hostel, library, and department( Last page )&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fill in all the details you know. Things people leave out are Guide names, Thesis titles and their names on all sheets. There is a misspelt “Certificate from the Acdemic section” on both  P2 and P3 forms, and a No Dues from estate Office. They are usually not required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.In Parallel,  start the process to submit the Convocation and Alumni Forms. Their details are as follows: 
Convocation form :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Login to &lt;a href=&quot;https://portal.iitb.ac.in/asc/Login&quot;&gt;ASC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pay Convocation Fee&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fill Convocation Form carefully. Check your name in Hindi too. Press space if the last part of your name does not get converted.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You may be asked to get a National Academic Depository (NAD) ID. It works for people with Adhaar linked to phone numbers. It is optional and it is Adhaar.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Print the form and sign on it &lt;strong&gt;with date&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Attach the copy of your bachelor’s degree. Do not have one? Chill and skip and go to next step.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Submit the form to Ms. Ranjana in Academic Department. She will tell you the process if you do not have a degree yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alumni Form:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Login to &lt;a href=&quot;https://portal.iitb.ac.in/asc/Login&quot;&gt;ASC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Click on the misspelt “Alumani” form.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fill the form to the best of your knowledge.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Print it and attach a photo to it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Submit it in the Alumni Office in Gullu building&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above two things can be done in parallel with the remaining process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.Thesis Mega Loop&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the craziest part of the &lt;strong&gt;P4&lt;/strong&gt;. The majority of the signatures that are in the form and are difficult to get are related to the thesis. The reports should have an abstract and follow the guidelines &lt;a href=&quot;http://etd.library.iitb.ac.in/etd/faq_s.jsp&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Make sure you have the following in your report :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;signatures of your guide, external/internal signatures in the reports.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;an abstract page ( Ideally before ToC )&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;your signature on the declaration&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;IIT Logo on the front page&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Roman numbering to all pages before Introduction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you get guide signature on report get signatures on Frontpage in P2, P3 columns and Respective P2 and P3 pages.  Let’s start with central library submissions :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Login to &lt;a href=&quot;http://etd.library.iitb.ac.in/etd/index.jsp&quot;&gt;ETD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fill out the information/Alumni form.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Now select Project 2, fill that form and upload the pdf. Copy and paste the abstract as already directed. You should get a confirmation page. Download the abstract page and take a print out. Sometimes, things do not work due to browsers. Use Firefox or Chrome and ultimately Edge.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Logout and do the same for P3 a.k.a Final Project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, print the abstract page and get guide signatures. Collect the uploaded P2 report and P3 report in a USB stick along with DRS report, P2 presentation, and P3 presentation. All should be in pdf format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Submit the five files to the IDC Library. Mohan sir may sign on item 1 (front page) and section 2.0 (page 2). Depending on the time of the day, you may get studio signatures or go to the central library. I assume you go to the Central Library. Arrive at the ETD office behind the reference section on the ground floor. Present the form with signed abstract sheets to the staff there. They will check the report format and stamp the P2 and P3 pages. In case, there is an issue with formatting, carry a laptop to make changes there itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;ProTip: Do not make reports in google docs. You apparently cannot number pages in the way library demands. Use LaTeX, InDesign or Scribus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that completes the Thesis Mega Loop. Before exiting the library, get the signatures and stamp of staff on the library no dues section ( last page). PS: The central library has alumni membership plans too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4.Workshop Hopper&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The workshop staff is really kind to be available all the time during clearance days. Start with Mawade Sir in Paint studio, then Santosh Sir in Ceramics, Kini Sir in Plastic, Samarth Sir in Wood and Navale Sir in Metal. Patil Sir signs for laser cutting studio, Clay studio (for all students except MVD), and workshop in charge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Progressing to the first floor, Kuldeep or Chakku sir sign for the sound studio, Divekar sir signs partly for Photo studio, the other part Mazhar sir signs. Now, on the second floor. Dhanashree Ma’am signs for Ergo Lab, seated in the same space, Prof. Sugandh will sign for CAID Lab. Finally, Prof. Purba signs for CNC and Cintiq studios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5.Home Run&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only sections that remain are associated with Hostel, Faculty Co-ordinator, and IDC Office. For Hostel 13, you will need the pink form from the warden. Pay the amount you are asked (using UPI) and then get the signatures done on the form. Technically, you should vacate rooms by 30th, but in case of extensions, you may be excused for a few days by producing a letter from the office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6.The Finisher&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Approach the faculty coordinator for your discipline. She/He will verify the details and sign on the front page and section 1.0 of page 2. Now submit the form in IDC office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are done !&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CAUTION: The process mentioned above was prevalent in the year 2018. The article was written with whatever knowledge I could gather during my clearance process. Things may change for good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers,&lt;/p&gt;
