        How do I look honey?
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">03 Apr 2017</span>

    <blockquote>
  <p>The project explores the social value of human beauty in a possible future (among many futures). In this imagined world, the society does not possess natural beauty due various genetic mutations triggered by solar flares. They live in a time where, beauty is simulated by technology. I explore many interactions in this future when a naturally occouring thing like human beauty, becomes manipulated and managed by technology, the kind of control, regulatory, market and misuse dialogues it generates. I presented the project as a solo act by developing prototype interactions that exist in the future. The vehicle to deliver the story was a log generated by a person who made such a technology. If someone knows about the <em>Judgement of Thamus</em> from <em>Plato’s Phaedrus</em> or/and <em>Neil Postman’s Technopoly</em>, a similar rhetoric was used but inside a story. I discuss things like digital cosmetics (now filters), beauty as a service, and liquid personalities. This project was done during Masters at IDC during the course Trends in Interaction Design by Prof. Venkat and Jayesh.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My project — <strong>How do I look, Honey?</strong>, explores and challenges the fundamental human bias of visual beauty. What happens when technology can alter that? How will you define it? Will it become an asset that will be controlled by the rich?</p>

<p>The story is set in a time when people are no longer beautiful. A catastrophic solar flare makes everyone ugly. People in these days use eyeAL devices which augment their vision to show them a digital persona of the real person. This digital persona can be stylized with cosmetics as in the past, but today these cosmetics are digital.People spend money to look good. They can things like fairness recharges or postpaid rental plans on beauty products. They can ensure they never age visually by paying for beauty insurance.</p>

<p>In this future, the advertisements have taken a huge leap. The ads at places recognize your intent to buy and pitch your products accordingly. People are known to rent their bodies to augment advertisements. Everything you see is personalized. You can also have digital furniture whose texture and color you can change without changing the sofa ever. Same goes for a lot of personalized things like cars. How will it be to look at such an augmented world?</p>

<p>The protagonist in my story is a person who is a part of the team that designed this device. He has been invited by his current self to explain the happenings of his day. In his days, the designers are not the one who design everything. Incremental designs are made by machines entirely and only when machines can’t rationalize the decision a human design debugger is looped in.</p>

<p>There are personality hackers that can digitally transplant your personality. Sometimes even the dead are known to commit crimes using transplanted personas. The government can block some people from being viewed by others as a formal of penalization.</p>

<p>How beautiful is such a world?</p>

<h4>Prototype</h4>

<p>In the prototype, I acted out as a hologram from the future world, explaining the happening of the future using the presentation. The audiences, were asked to interact with the hologram (i.e me) using an AR app I made.</p>

<p>The technologies I used were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>AR.js (which uses AFrame and Three.js)</li>
  <li>Processing and OpenCV for Blocked and Face Tracking demos</li>
</ul>

        Hacking with Bamboo in the Field
      </a>

    <blockquote>
  <p>This post describes the work done as a part of a course I took at <em>School of Design, IIT Bombay</em> . The name of the course is <strong>Field Study and Design</strong>. It involved students innovating while living in the context. Living in a village for a few weeks and building cool stuff. Sounds exciting.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="build-up">Build Up</h2>
<p>It started with a poster, I saw when we had to choose our electives for this semester. Riding the segmentation feeling that this might be a product design course and hence, I should probably not take it, I took a course on Postmodernism. But, the poster stayed there and triggered an interrupt in the mind. It had all the likable qualities of a course - Outdoor, Gujarat, Making and Freshness. It took a while for the intellectual capacitance to charge the gates of my decision gates ( Shit that was good ) and I asked the course instructor, Prof. Nishant Sharma, in staircase one-day that I was interested in the course. He was open and asked me to mail him, which I promptly did.</p>

<p>We met and he approved me for the course. That’s not it. A great battle has to start. I unregistered myself from Post-modernism and the system won’t allow me to register for this, on the last day of course registration. The course was capped at 8. I was the 8th student. I did all the office - to- office to find where the problem was. No one knew. It was depressing. No one knew what the problem was. It turned out that the course would only accept “PD” or “MVD” guys. No one knew about this restriction. I was eventually given a 30 min window to register. Tada!</p>

<h2 id="preparation">Preparation</h2>

<p>The course involved students going in a village in Gujarat- Ambapada , known for its Bamboo crafts and then study the context and design products that the craftsmen could actually make using their current skill set and they should be modern and functional. Then later, we would <em>transfer</em>the design to the craftsmen who could make it and sell it.</p>

<p>The course was partially supported by <a href="http://www.baif.org.in/">BAIF</a> who offered us accommodation, workspace and access to the community at their campus and village.</p>

<p>We started with thinking about what we could do and things to take. I would take my electronics and I wanted to make something with electronics and also explore some forms. Before we left, we visited Kalbhadevi and Lamington to get stuff for our course.</p>

<h2 id="landing-and-prototyping">Landing and Prototyping</h2>

<p>After about 6 hours of drive from IIT, we reached the village <a href="http://wikiedit.org/India/Lachhakadi/163258/">Lachhakadi</a>, where BAIF’s Dhruva campus is located.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/33769581365/in/album-72157680969109736/" title="BAIF"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2945/33769581365_f5b6d779a3_z.jpg" width="640" height="424" alt="BAIF" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>After reaching, we visited the craftsmen village of Ambapada and their shops in Gira waterfalls in Saputara. It was great to see the way the craftsmen work by using ingenuous techniques like this Belt Sander made by BAIF’s Anant .</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/32422163944/in/album-72157680969109736/" title="DSC_1219"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/694/32422163944_71f7552532_z.jpg" width="640" height="426" alt="DSC_1219" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Marketplace at Gira falls. They sell stuff that they make , but mostly its the stuff from China.

<p>We spent the next few days, brain storming, material storming and ideating on things that we could do. I lost my sketchbook :(</p>

<p>Not that It was any good. The ideas I had were torches, self-watering pots, holders, running windmill that changes color when your run, audio curtains, power banks, radios, xylophones, Solar lamps and some random electronics.</p>

<p>I sketched a few and showed it for review and then made prototypes. So, the schedule was:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Wake up at 6:00-6:30 am</li>
  <li>Walk to places around</li>
  <li>Play Badminton</li>
  <li>Have Breakfast till 8:30 am</li>
  <li>Work in the shop till 12:30 pm</li>
  <li>Lunch at 12:30 pm</li>
  <li>Sleep for 20 mins</li>
  <li>Workshop at 1:15 pm</li>
  <li>Tea at 4:00 pm</li>
  <li>Workshop till 8:30 pm</li>
  <li>Dinner at 8:30 pm</li>
  <li>Workshop/Sleep/Bonfire/Mela Visit</li>
</ol>

<p>The workshop was this space. It was currently a testing ground for a Bamboo pen manufacturing system, a brainchild of Anant. Anant has his startup working with Bamboo products. He is a very interesting and brainy person. He helped us evaluate our ideas based on his knowledge of the locals and their biases.</p>

<p>Prototyping was done and then call was to be taken on what to do. I ended up making the running rotating windmill, holders, agarbatti holder cum packaging and power bank.</p>

<p>The products were designed studying the current craftsmen and their resource availability and the demands and trends in their possible markets like Gira Waterfalls and Surat. Products designed by everyone were fantastic and showed a great deal of craftsmanship.</p>

<p>To test how craftsmen would bring things and also to bring some magnets and hardware we also conducted a one-day return journey to Mumbai by Flying Rani Express that stops at Bilimora Station. This journey alone is worth a blog post. Hashtags : #FreezingColdBikeRide #2xDDLJTrainScene #Fine #NoFood #MumbaiBhraman #DeadTired</p>

<p>We also visited Surat and Dandi on a day off. It was an amazing trip. Surat is an amazing city. We visited SVNIT, Diamond Museum, Science Center, Sasuji Thali, Public Aquarium (They have sharks) etc.</p>

<h2 id="design-transfer-and-training">Design Transfer and Training</h2>

<p>The next step was to train the local craftsmen to produce the things that we had designed. This part was rather interesting part of the design out of the studio theme of the course. The craftsman who chose to make my holder, Satish was from a nearby village. I used methods of contextual inquiry to learn more about his work. He is sufficiently technically literate. Has an Android phone, but carries a Nokia Asha. He has DTH TV system and uses the Internet also. He showed me the photos of his previous exhibitions around the country. He travels with his elder brother and works on bamboo making things like whistles, peacocks and gifting materials. He also works on his land, but the yield was probably not much. He was introduced to this art by his father. They are not from Gujrat and are Maharashtrians. No wonder he could make sense of my senseless Marathi.</p>

<p>To enable him to replicate my design of a keychain/Toothbrush holder inspired from a shark’s jaw, I made a template that had to be used on a bamboo piece and then I gave him my version of it. We made two iterations.</p>

<p>First one was made using my template, But due to fact that he was more familiar with the material, he could actually cut down the time and work required to make it. I took 4 hours to make it and he did it in 25 mins. Material Masters are a thing.</p>

<p>The next time he did not use the template. It was faster, but it was not as finished as it should be. He said it would be fine if he could make a few more. This actually helps us understand the fundamental difference in which how we think we will teach them by handling them the plans and how they take it as an incremental addition to their “can-do” things.</p>

<p>I did some electronics hacking too. We basically hacked a locally available Ni-Mh Solar Lantern to be charged with a USB charger. Recipe? Current Sources. It worked great. I frankly am in love with Current Sources since then.</p>

<h2 id="exhibition-and-public-showcase">Exhibition and Public Showcase</h2>

<p>The last part was to gauge public sentiments on the products we made and ask for feedback at the same place where these products are sold. This would also establish some faith in the products for the local craftsmen who were around, as they have to make them in the future. It was grand. Pictures follow.</p>

<p>The feedback was great and this was later followed by an interactive session with local craftsmen who told us about the price to expect, markets and difficulty they might face.</p>

    <span class="post-date">22 Mar 2017</span>

    <p>Back from yet another cycling trip are we?
This one was one of the recent best. Inspired by recent events of aimless discovery, we planned to go to <strong>Vipasana Pagoda</strong> and obviously detours. This time we were 3 people. Thadu, an energetic , super entu junior from BDes course and guess what, he has the guts to carry a full framers while cycling &gt;100k . So, as a story of our trips. We had a planned a route that we missed. I had bought <em>pebble</em> specifically for these activities. Only to discover that Google maps does not push notifications to pebble anymore !! <em>Duh</em> Anyone has options? I am all ears. Anyways <em>Endomondo</em> works great and we averaged 2:50 min/km on most roads.</p>

<p>So, the route was meant to be we take eastern, till Thane and then Fountain Chowk (yes! time does get dilated here), then beat some ghats and then go to Pagoda without going through the creeks and comeback from Versova after covering Gorai and Uttan beach. Much of it was inspired from <a href="http://bijoor.me/2013/03/31/cycling-along-the-mangroves-of-mumbai/">this</a> amazing cycling blog by Ashutosh.</p>

<p>But it did not end up like that.</p>

<p>We did took Eastern and cycled till Fountain Chowk. Here is a selfie at the chowk. This was probably the fastest sprint. Averaging around 2:15/km . But the roads were bad we you go down hill and without the front shocks you cant do some cylobatics.
But we made it, I had my <em>dogs-after-me</em> moment too. Somehow I attract Dogs randomly. At least this time I did not fall.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/32704845494/in/dateposted-public/" title="IMG_20170319_080327"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/4/3672/32704845494_36211608a9_z.jpg" width="640" height="360" alt="IMG_20170319_080327" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>We somehow ended up in Borivali after that and had to take a <em>ferry</em> to cross the creek. CHECK</p>

<p>But as we moved towards the port, we could see the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Vipassana_Pagoda">Pagoda</a> in its magnificent brilliance inviting us.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/33507712956/in/dateposted-public/" title="IMG_20170319_094753"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/4/3767/33507712956_0274c33d3f_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_20170319_094753" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The next part of the journey was great. We visited Pagoda. Attended their 10 min Meditation session in the north pagoda.</p>

<p>The entry was magnificent and we felt as if we are at a film set or a slice of alternate reality embedded in our space .

<p>The walls of the pagoda were all painted in golden color. Felt royal. The doors were made from wood imported from Burma. On the top of the Pagoda were some parts of the holy remains of Lord Buddha.</p>

<p>After the Pagoda, we had planned for Gorai, but thought we would cycle till Uttan beach and visit a great church there. Cycling till Uttan was an experience, the grade was a bit too much in the noon. But the Church was amazing, Worth it.</p>

<p>We also saw, a giant statue of Mother Mary with a classic Mediterranean feel and color palette. We could see the lighthouses around too.</p>

<p>Cycles at Uttan Beach. Almost got washed away as the sea transitioned from Low to High tide as we were exploring the beach</p>

<p>Crossing the Beaches Dinojh Style. So, this will be interesting. We had to see Gorai, because from what we could see it was far more happening than Uttan. Now, we could take the road, that was too much grade or cross from beach to beach. But <em>High Tide</em>. What a bystander suggested, “Your cycles are good, maybe you could carry it over the rocks?”</p>

<p>Me, “Carry? Cycles? They cant be classified in a logical set together”</p>

<p>Dinojh,” Come fast guys, I am already up here!”</p>

<p>Damn.. It was difficult to carry the cycle on the slippery rocks and stuff. Thanks to Dinojh, who helped me a lot. He actually carried it for most of the time. From now on Gorai beach was renamed, <strong>Dinojh Beach</strong>. #SuperManh</p>

<p>Gorai Beach</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/33164972220/in/dateposted-public/" title="2017-03-19 02.50.40 1"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2857/33164972220_7572c70a07_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="2017-03-19 02.50.40 1" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>From Gorai we cycled endlessly till we reached the port and then ferry &gt; Borivali &gt; Western</p>

<p><strong>Then</strong></p>

<p>Cycle punctured by apparently what looks like a fish-bone. BTwin tubes are super bad. They just cant be fixed. Needs replacement of the tube. This is the second time this is happening to me. Bad BTWin.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/32734078153/in/dateposted-public/" title="IMG_20170319_173536"><img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/4/3753/32734078153_e91e486a6c_z.jpg" width="480" height="640" alt="IMG_20170319_173536" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>We did not continue on Western as it was too hot and we took, the Aarey colony road till Powai and then reached IIT.</p>

<p>Phew. I just crashed after reaching, only to wake up 2 hours later with tons of assignments in my bad waiting to be started and a lingering taste of the adventure of the day resonating in the background.</p>

<p>Until next time.</p>

<p>さよなら</p>

<p>再见</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>
