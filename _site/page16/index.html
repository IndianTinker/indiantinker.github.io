        Exif Data on Linux
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">18 Jun 2016</span>

    <p>A friend was recently on a look-out for a camera (DSLR) for a project and was trying various options. Since the residual life of the camera depends on the <em>Shutter Count</em> ; its worth-while to check it before committing to it. BTW, If you need more pointers on evaluating a pre-owned Camera, I would sincerely recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BxXPTIvtHA">this</a> video. PS: Language might not be suitable for younger audiences.</p>

<p>On Linux (other platforms too) there is a nice tool called <strong>ExifTool</strong> which was, as of writing this post available in the package manager of <em>Ubuntu</em> .</p>

<p>So, Simply 
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sudo apt-get install exiftool</code></p>

<p>In order to use it, Simply go to the SD Card (generally) and <em>Right Click</em> to open terminal here. Then use the command.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">exiftool DSC_0004.JPG |grep "Shutter Count"</code></p>

<p>Shutter Count should be visible, But depends on the camera you use. Most <strong>Nikons</strong> we tested had this meta tag in the EXIF(Exchangeable image file format) data of the image, but the only Canon we tested was 1200D which did not show any data.</p>

<p>To know more about EXIF check out <a href="http://www.media.mit.edu/pia/Research/deepview/exif.html">this</a> resource .</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>

        Getting started with WIO Link
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">11 Apr 2016</span>

    <p><a href="https://github.com/anujdeshpande/">Anuj</a> recently gave me one of the few <em>WIO Links</em> he got as a <s>serial</s> Kickstarter backer to try them out. The Wio Link are</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>No programming required ESP8266 based grove compatible boards with on-board USB-Serial and Li-ion battery charger. It essentially provides <strong>Grove</strong> sensors a Web API kind of look.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/26097749300/in/dateposted-public/" title="20160409_192105"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1546/26097749300_6fd8a7a041_z.jpg" width="640" height="360" alt="20160409_192105" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>So you have these methods that are associated with various sensors/devices based on its functionality. Like an LED will have ON/OFF methods etc and a switch will have its status and so on. They can be programmed with an App which later provides you with <em>API Endpoints</em> to control the devices using basic HTTP urls in curl for example.</p>

<p>In this post, i walk you through the steps, just in case you got the Wio Link as well and we control an LED connected to the WIO link through the App itself. 
You start with downloading the app from the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cc.seeed.iot.ap">Playstore</a>. The App starts with a sign-in process. Outside China, you have to choose the international server. Login and make an account. The app has a tour in which it asks you to press a button on the WioLink that basically turns the WioLink in an AP so, you can identify it and share the login credentials for your Wifi. I got this error.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/26304355621/in/dateposted-public/" title="Error1"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1708/26304355621_d442b22c84_z.jpg" width="360" height="640" alt="Error1" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Errors are good omens. Retrying i saw the Wio Link.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/25767852413/in/dateposted-public/" title="1"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1704/25767852413_1131d7c1ba_z.jpg" width="360" height="640" alt="1" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The App is not the best designed one for the purpose. It is not that user friendly and maybe Seeed will improve upon it. Next the App asks you to give the credentials to the Wifi that will be used by the Wio Link to talk.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/25767852363/in/dateposted-public/" title="2"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1633/25767852363_b6c6bbbe17_z.jpg" width="360" height="640" alt="2" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Once thats done. You get the Visual WioLink to Add Groves to.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/25767852273/in/dateposted-public/" title="4"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1579/25767852273_599022c3d3_z.jpg" width="360" height="640" alt="4" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Now here’s a thing. If at this point you click API or Click Update and then click API you get the following error.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/26278225372/in/dateposted-public/" title="Error2"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1535/26278225372_caac01d812_z.jpg" width="360" height="640" alt="Error2" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>This action should be restricted in the App.The groves are not very well organised making to difficult to find things. I could not find the LED one that i have. So, went for the Relay as in the end i needed a digital output. Also added a switch just in case.</p>

<p>PS: Ignore the Infrared Emitter. I thought it was an LED at the time of taking the screen shot. Only to figure it out later :p</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/26097737210/in/dateposted-public/" title="6"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1693/26097737210_f129470123_z.jpg" width="360" height="640" alt="6" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Now once you click <strong>Update</strong> the App configures the Wio Link and enables a set of API to control the groves. I am not sure what it does here. Uploading the code from phone to the grove does not seem to be happening, maybe they enable/update some flags or a look-up table. Just Guessing !<br />
<a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/26304354631/in/dateposted-public/" title="Upload"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1665/26304354631_14b9334f97_z.jpg" width="360" height="640" alt="Upload" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Once this is done, on the home screen you see this :</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/26344667386/in/dateposted-public/" title="FINAL"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1656/26344667386_a9e0a13aa6_z.jpg" width="360" height="640" alt="FINAL" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Now Lets see how the <strong>API</strong> looks like.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/26097736540/in/dateposted-public/" title="LEDApi"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1715/26097736540_c47cba5c70_z.jpg" width="360" height="640" alt="LEDApi" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>The best thing is that they provide the ability to make requests from the App itself. This comes handy to test things quickly. Here i send 1 to the Wio Link in hopes to turn the LED on.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/26278224872/in/dateposted-public/" title="LED On APi"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1555/26278224872_0cbe5679e8_z.jpg" width="360" height="640" alt="LED On APi" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Wohoo! Works the very first time. :D</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/25767855573/in/dateposted-public/" title="LED ON"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1667/25767855573_e7edc6994f_z.jpg" width="640" height="360" alt="LED ON" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Now the LED Off Case. I send 0.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/26097736430/in/dateposted-public/" title="LED Off api"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1534/26097736430_2ab9c03492_z.jpg" width="360" height="640" alt="LED Off api" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Voila.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/26097744790/in/dateposted-public/" title="LED Off"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1463/26097744790_26c971e90e_z.jpg" width="640" height="360" alt="LED Off" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I just love the simplicity and fun of working with the WioLink. Truly fantastic what Seeed is offering at this price. They have to work a bit on the App as it crashes often. Rest all is in place. Lets see what more can we build with this !</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>

    <blockquote>
  <p>This post describes the work done during my time at Tata Motors Research Center in Pune. I worked as an Assistant Manager in Human Machine Interface department. I was a project lead for this project from my team. Here, I present my work on designing and testing the initial release of Tata Motors ConnectNeXt App Ecosystem.  Work in the post was done between 2015-Q1 2016. I was involved in system design, testing, and user evaluation.</p>

<h4>Context</h4>
<p>This is 2014, Vehicle infotainment systems are getting more and more computation heavy. The customer demands more connection and driving needs to be data-informed (driven). The competition has some derived solutions in the market. We needed to respond by building our own contextual telematics ecosystem. I was involved as a Lead from PAT side in the project when the dev and design already had some ideas and had some prototypes being tested. My task was to rethink and improve the project- ConnectNeXt, from a user-centric point of view.  It is one of those projects, you are on the team and have to fight for the user. Then not be lured by the cool technology that could possibly take too much attention while driving. Not making an App need attention was the task. Android auto was still very new.</p>

<h4>Work</h4>
<p>I worked with many designs and dev teams (across 3 companies) in my role as a design integrator for the project. We studied the designed screen and flows. We did reviews of iconography, typography, and information architecture. Nitpicking things and presenting the user’s point was the goal. There were experiments to make apps that would adjust the visuals to the time of the day. The interaction points in the app were designed to be operated in a road filled with potholes. We simulated this condition using a torture track. This helped us move critical/decision points outside the primary interface. We researched about in-vehicle safety. Safety is at the top while using such apps in vehicles. With some benchmarking data, our user studies, and simulations, we designed some rough guidelines for vehicle-based apps on TML platform.  The idea was to have a central app that auto-configures based on the vehicle it is connected. The app would suggest possible compatible apps from the ecosystem. Then, it configures them. This is the connectNeXt app. About 150+ use cases were to be designed, implemented, and tested. Once the interface layer of these apps was sorted as a system, we moved on scoping the feature matrix. The entire operation was based on the Smartlink protocol stack, and hence we worked with a lot of connection, reconnection, and disconnection use cases over Bluetooth and/or USB.  All these apps are now in playstore.</p>

<h4>Learnings</h4>
<p>This was one of the things, I am kind of proud of. A lot of things come to light when thinking as the process. The API calls, UI layers, car data, user privacy, variable in a car, no internet, failure cases, and finally edge cases. I learned things like JIRA, App Ecosystem, CAN Tools, Vehicle Diagnostics, Vehicle safety, process maps, and doing projects with a lot of different stakeholders. The testing part of the project was fun. Initially, we were all communicating by logging bugs in JIRA. I did not even know people by their faces, just by their JIRA user names. But later, It was getting difficult to explain some very typical use cases. So, we decided on doing extensive all day collaboration drives with stakeholders. I used to drive in Pune and neighboring cities. We were logging data and simulating events, with the app developer and infotainment developers sitting in the car. They were initially scared of sitting in a camouflaged car. But, we were fixing more than 20+ bugs a day. I won an award for my work with the project too.</p>

<h4>How it affected the company</h4>
<p>I feel, it laid the foundations of what connectneXt is today. The company position transformed from being competitive in the market to become market leaders. The best part was all the tech and design was in-house and the company can virtually do anything the customer needs without sticking to the excel-sheet approach of many suppliers.</p>
