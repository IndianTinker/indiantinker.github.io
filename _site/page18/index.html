        SpectraVUlizer- Lights,Music and Magic
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">04 Feb 2016</span>

    <p>One day while chatting with my good friend <a href="https://twitter.com/mrrituparna">Rituparna</a> we stumbled upon building a sound reactive light for Ritu’s Ritz Car. Amplitude based light would be too stale for his taste and we needed something that was more <em>dhinchaak</em>. So why not visualize music in the frequency domain as well. So, as the sound changes bands we could change the color of his car’s interiors.</p>

<p>Hence we would certainly have to do some FFT so we have an idea of the relative amplitude of sound in different bands and then use the Neo Pixel strips to visualize the pattern. We planned to use the <a href="http://tah.io/">Tah</a> as our number cruncher of choice.</p>

<p>One fine afternoon we met at <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Doo-Things/">doo Things</a> to get the project up and running. We decided to use the <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Components/General/MSGEQ7.pdf">MSGEQ7</a> which is a Seven Band Graphic Equalizer and produces analog voltages of the value of signal in a particular band. Its not difficult to interface and would help us update the strip real-time which could be difficult with software FFTs. Also it was directly capable of receiving signal from the standard 3.5mm line saving us with effort to make an amplifier if we used the standard FFT libraries.
Reading it is similar to how you read a shift register.</p>

<p>We followed the standard circuit from the datasheet and programmed the <strong>Tah</strong> to read the signal and reflect the same on the neo-pixels. The whole circuit was built on a perfboard and powered by a standard 5V Adapter.</p>

<p>
So basically when we notice a higher value in the lowest band which is basically due to the percussion instruments used in the song. We make the whole strip flash. Check this out in the video below.

        Incar Navigation
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">02 Feb 2016</span>

    <blockquote>
  <p>This post describes the work done during my time at Tata Motors Research Center in Pune. I worked as an Assistant Manager in Human Machine Interface department. Here, I present my work on defining strategies to improve in-car navigation. The work was first used in Tata Tiago/Tigor.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/XInwt0L.jpg" alt="Imgur" /></p>

<h4>Context</h4>
<p>This project was done between Q2 2015- Q1 2016. Following the mobile navigation boom in India, it was observed that a lot of people used navigation in a car. Customers seem to have a behavior of pairing the audio of the phone to the infotainment and using the audio to navigate. Since road names are often not well represented in India, they still had to look at the mobile screen. This diverted their attention from the road. The need was to provide basic navigation features on the entry-level infotainment systems (Level A - now discontinued:/). The entire navigation instructions were to be rendered on the dot matrix panel. The partners were MapMyIndia, Harman, and Tata Motors. The project was challenging as the hardware resources on Level A were limited.</p>

<h4>Work</h4>
<p>Our work started with understanding how the system is working. We made process flows. The entire thing worked via Bluetooth on Android. Android, in general, is a heterogeneous platform. Every manufacturer tries something funny with Bluetooth. The BT stack, in general, is not very big to allow lots of information to be pushed to it. This is especially when two connections are handled by the infotainment- A2DP and SPP. The design required them to work simultaneously. The whole thing was very tight. We started by testing and defining (with whatever we could) the first use scenarios and then later moved into using the system with other infotainment functions. This activity may have been late in the whole process. After a few months of hard work, the sun was brighter again, and we moved to test, find, and fix mode. This time we found implementation bugs and UX issues with phone integration. A few more sunburns later, we have a pre-release which was rolled out to certain customers. A study was designed to understand how users get the system working and use it.  Because of such tests, the system improved and we had a month or two to perform regression testing to shape the product better. The regression testing helped find some edge cases and fix them. Until finally, before the launch, we had a working navigation system on a teeny tiny Level A system. Nobody expected that. However, the story does not end here. Even though we eased a lot of pinpoints, there could be some always. It was a trade-off or fill into Android Auto based products.</p>

<h4>Learnings</h4>
<p>I learned how to work on projects in which design integration is the key to match customer experience with technology and feature requests. The work involved working under technical constraints and provide the best experience. I learned how log bug reports in an easy to reproduce manner. The hybrid testing, design, and develop style was a thing, I still love. The work gave me a lot of sense of how scalable products are made in a fast-paced environment. It taught me a bit about hierarchy and how a big company works. Another thing, I learned was that design of such complex interconnected products may always have some rough edges even when in production. These rough edges or bugs are fixed over time.</p>

<h4>How it affected the company</h4>
<p>TML became the first company to offer navigation support to entry-level cars. Customer and media loved it, with the launch of Tiago. I have learned that since it is no longer economically viable to use the Level A system compared to other alternatives, it has been discontinued. But, I love my Level A.</p>

        RXing into the HAM World using RTL-SDR
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">31 Jan 2016</span>

    <p>I have been intrigued by HAM ever since Prof.Gadre mentioned about it in one of his lectures. HAM has an amazing community and i have been fortunate to be included into one here in Pune. Special Thanks to <a href="http://amoghdesai.com/">VU3DES</a> and <a href="http://tinkertool.wordpress.com">VU2ASH</a>.</p>

<p>The HAM group in Pune is a group of <em>highly</em> motivated and dedicated HAM enthusiasts and regularly have conversations on the HAM frequencies. They open-heartedly encourage n00bs to get their feet wet in the HAM world..</p>

<p>Frankly, the initial days were tough as the jargon used in HAM is intense and i could not make out many times what the conversations meant. Slowly with Amogh’s help I figured out most of it. For Example: DIYers are called Home Brewers.</p>

<p>As Amogh suggested, i started with building a 2M Band (140MHz) antenna and using it with my <a href="/2015/10/12/RTLSDR1/">RTL SDR Dongle</a>.
The process involved severing my already working cable that connects to the tiny antenna using which i can do lots of cool things like tracking flying objects using ADSb, A post my hands are itching to write but looking at the growing <em>intolerance</em>, a few friends have cautioned me into not exploring stuff in the grey area more. If anyone with a better understanding of the grey value in this area reads it, please do tell me. Nevertheless, Cool things have to be risked to achieve cooler things. There you go, nice cable.</p>

<p>Well, 2M is the n00bs band. Listening stuff is pretty easy with basic components costing less than a <em>Vada Pao</em> . RXing to most things (not all) is legal and this was quite relieving.</p>

<p>BTW, the easiest antenna i plan to build was a <strong>Vertical Dipole</strong>. It largely has two(dipole) elements/wires/conductors that have a strict length and are (as the name suggests) oriented vertical to the ground. There is a simple equation that governs the length of the antenna elements.</p>

<p>The band is 2M, hence, the minimum antenna length should be lamda/4 . So, it is about 2/4=0.5m or 50cm or roughly 19.6 inches. So, we need two pieces of wire of 19.6 inches in length each and wired to our SDR cable. Amogh sent me a very detailed picture at the time of construction, which i lost. :(</p>

<p>The SDR cable is essentially like those old RF in Co-Ax cables we receive cable TV from in our houses. The outer part is negative or shield and the centre part is signal or positive. I got the cheap iron wire that is used to tie re-bars in construction; they were frankly very sturdy and held shape. I measured and cut 19.6 inch elements with a little room of bending it.</p>

<p>The frame (well sort of) was made using a T junction and  pipe segments with Tinned nut and bolts to the ends as they can be soldered.</p>

<p>I hot-glued one end and kept the other end free. This allowed me to fold the antenna and take it out of the cramped window and re-open it again outside.</p>

<p>Now it was time to search for a open space. Since most people talk using Handies (Hand-held radios) with too low power(5W is my guess) and i am apparently the farthest from them. Most of them are in Pune, while I am pretty far away in PCMC . Also, the height at which they transmit also matter a lot. The only open place was a little used balcony. I made my base there and fixed the antenna with my Safety shoe. The SDR settings are 145.1Mhz and modulation is NFM.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/23872027191/in/dateposted-public/" title="IMG_20151222_215517"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5735/23872027191_1a1f2e7094_z.jpg" width="480" height="640" alt="IMG_20151222_215517" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>We have a active group and i requested for anyone to transmit on 145.1 MHz. A session was planned at 10pm. I guess i had to wait till then. Even at 10pm, i was getting nothing, just noise. I fiddled with the bandwidth on the SDR console and voila i could hear Rachit talking. He was probably on a Handy and hence his signal was weak. Then when VU2ASH talked it was like WoW. I literally had moist eyes, as if i had intercepted an alien signal or something. He stays at a high place and has a great antenna. I had to increase bandwidth to be able to hear him clearly. So, the whole time i was fiddling with Bandwidth controls and could hear the entire thing and yeah the <em>other</em> things still work :D</p>

<p>Next up? I will probably use my not-in-active-use raspberry pi to make an always ON HAM receiver tagged to our frequency and also improve the antenna.
Do you have any leads on things that can be done? Please do share in the comments section below.</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>

<p>Rohit</p>
