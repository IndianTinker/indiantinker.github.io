        RXing into the HAM World using RTL-SDR
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">31 Jan 2016</span>

    <p>I have been intrigued by HAM ever since Prof.Gadre mentioned about it in one of his lectures. HAM has an amazing community and i have been fortunate to be included into one here in Pune. Special Thanks to <a href="http://amoghdesai.com/">VU3DES</a> and <a href="http://tinkertool.wordpress.com">VU2ASH</a>.</p>

<p>The HAM group in Pune is a group of <em>highly</em> motivated and dedicated HAM enthusiasts and regularly have conversations on the HAM frequencies. They open-heartedly encourage n00bs to get their feet wet in the HAM world..</p>

<p>Frankly, the initial days were tough as the jargon used in HAM is intense and i could not make out many times what the conversations meant. Slowly with Amogh’s help I figured out most of it. For Example: DIYers are called Home Brewers.</p>

<p>As Amogh suggested, i started with building a 2M Band (140MHz) antenna and using it with my <a href="/2015/10/12/RTLSDR1/">RTL SDR Dongle</a>.
The process involved severing my already working cable that connects to the tiny antenna using which i can do lots of cool things like tracking flying objects using ADSb, A post my hands are itching to write but looking at the growing <em>intolerance</em>, a few friends have cautioned me into not exploring stuff in the grey area more. If anyone with a better understanding of the grey value in this area reads it, please do tell me. Nevertheless, Cool things have to be risked to achieve cooler things. There you go, nice cable.</p>

<p>Well, 2M is the n00bs band. Listening stuff is pretty easy with basic components costing less than a <em>Vada Pao</em> . RXing to most things (not all) is legal and this was quite relieving.</p>

<p>BTW, the easiest antenna i plan to build was a <strong>Vertical Dipole</strong>. It largely has two(dipole) elements/wires/conductors that have a strict length and are (as the name suggests) oriented vertical to the ground. There is a simple equation that governs the length of the antenna elements.</p>

<p>The band is 2M, hence, the minimum antenna length should be lamda/4 . So, it is about 2/4=0.5m or 50cm or roughly 19.6 inches. So, we need two pieces of wire of 19.6 inches in length each and wired to our SDR cable. Amogh sent me a very detailed picture at the time of construction, which i lost. :(</p>

<p>The SDR cable is essentially like those old RF in Co-Ax cables we receive cable TV from in our houses. The outer part is negative or shield and the centre part is signal or positive. I got the cheap iron wire that is used to tie re-bars in construction; they were frankly very sturdy and held shape. I measured and cut 19.6 inch elements with a little room of bending it.</p>

<p>The frame (well sort of) was made using a T junction and  pipe segments with Tinned nut and bolts to the ends as they can be soldered.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/23586681329/in/dateposted-public/" title="IMG_20151222_192951"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1482/23586681329_7ff69b2556_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_20151222_192951" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Soldered</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/23327760413/in/dateposted-public/" title="IMG_20151222_193021"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1445/23327760413_ef36ffc9c9_z.jpg" width="480" height="640" alt="IMG_20151222_193021" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>I hot-glued one end and kept the other end free. This allowed me to fold the antenna and take it out of the cramped window and re-open it again outside.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/23327760983/in/dateposted-public/" title="IMG_20151222_194750"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1454/23327760983_c15f7745b6_z.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="IMG_20151222_194750" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Now it was time to search for a open space. Since most people talk using Handies (Hand-held radios) with too low power(5W is my guess) and i am apparently the farthest from them. Most of them are in Pune, while I am pretty far away in PCMC . Also, the height at which they transmit also matter a lot. The only open place was a little used balcony. I made my base there and fixed the antenna with my Safety shoe. The SDR settings are 145.1Mhz and modulation is NFM.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94411929@N06/23872027191/in/dateposted-public/" title="IMG_20151222_215517"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5735/23872027191_1a1f2e7094_z.jpg" width="480" height="640" alt="IMG_20151222_215517" /></a><script async="" src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>We have a active group and i requested for anyone to transmit on 145.1 MHz. A session was planned at 10pm. I guess i had to wait till then. Even at 10pm, i was getting nothing, just noise. I fiddled with the bandwidth on the SDR console and voila i could hear Rachit talking. He was probably on a Handy and hence his signal was weak. Then when VU2ASH talked it was like WoW. I literally had moist eyes, as if i had intercepted an alien signal or something. He stays at a high place and has a great antenna. I had to increase bandwidth to be able to hear him clearly. So, the whole time i was fiddling with Bandwidth controls and could hear the entire thing and yeah the <em>other</em> things still work :D</p>

<p>Next up? I will probably use my not-in-active-use raspberry pi to make an always ON HAM receiver tagged to our frequency and also improve the antenna.
Do you have any leads on things that can be done? Please do share in the comments section below.</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>

    <p>Standies? They are everywhere. Every event. Every exhibition, Flying around, falling down numerous times, a pain to manage them and even get people to read it.</p>

<p>We had the opportunity to design a reactive standie for <a href="http://saavn.com/">Saavn</a> that will be present at their stalls throughout NH7 2015 Music festival.</p>

<p>Its apparently a XXL Sized phone with a UI that lists the artists playing at that festival and has their albums on the standie itself.</p>

<p>So, like a big screen a person could walk and press/tap/touch their artist and enjoy the selected music for the festival.</p>

<p><img src="https://interactive.makerville.io/images/Saavn.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Checkout out the video of the standie in action.</p>

        Maker's Rule-The Feature Packed PCB Multi-Tool
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">01 Jan 2016</span>

    <p>It has been a while since i posted my <a href="/2014/12/14/Tinker-Rule/">Tinker Rule</a> which i made during college days. I received a few requests for the ready to etch pdf which helped me gauge if this seemed to be useful to people. The response was somewhat positive and so, i decided to put in some extra effort and make it handy, portable and <strong>manufacturable</strong> !</p>

<p>My initial scale was big and not handy, So, this one should be small and compact and must not miss a single feature from its ancestor.
This one has :</p>

<ul>
  <li>0.1 inch grid to quickly prototype/resolve parts for perf-boarding or part creation</li>
  <li>A collection of footprints and holes to quickly compare parts</li>
  <li>A small pad with a sand paper to rust off those berg strips/resistor ends that just wont solder located ergonomically at the end to allow easy motion</li>
  <li>A key chain form factor</li>
  <li>A LED Tester</li>
  <li>A continuity tester compatible with most common 4.5mm banana plug type probes and alternatively alligator clips too</li>
  <li>A reference section for common equations,scales and track widths.</li>
  <li>0.1 inch scale at right angles</li>
  <li>1 mm resolution scale at right angles</li>
</ul>

<p>I made an initial to-scale mockup to verify the parts and ergonomics.</p>

<p>Then redesigned the board iteratively in KiCAD. The size was a bit higher to utilise the low volume PCB fabs from China.This presented an opportunity to search and try some local manufacturers and add a month to the project. Most of them <em>unfortunately</em> gave disappointing replies to mails for low volume production.</p>

<p>Aghasted, I started street searching for PCB manufacturers here in Pune. Fortunately, I live near an Industrial Area and <em>Just Dial</em> churned out a humble number of results. I visited a few of them and finalised one based on cost, quality and turn around time. But had to re-design it yet again to match the tolerances.</p>

<p>But Yeah!</p>

<p><em>Made In India</em> :D</p>

<p>Here is what i managed to make :</p>

<p>The 5mm hole doubles up as a key-chain ring.</p>

<p>Use normal multimeter probes with the Maker’s Rule for continuity testing. My multimeter meter has a habit of dying down when i need it the most to check continuity of newly etched PCB. Here i use a 0805 LED for the output.</p>

<p>A LED Tester that helps you test those LEDs with equal leads or SMD packages with no marking.</p>

<p>A fine grit sand paper to beat some rust.</p>

<p>The first few PCBs had a drill issue as the 2.8mm drill hole was drilled by a 2.5mm one. I had to get them drilled again.</p>

<p>I have listed it on <a href="https://www.tindie.com/products/IndianTinker/makers-rule-the-diyers-swiss-army-knife/">Tindie</a> if anyone is interested.It ships with a key-chain blank, A CR2032 Battery and the Rule of-course.</p>

<p>Also any customisations like putting your logo/content on it are also welcomed.</p>

<p>Cheers !!</p>
