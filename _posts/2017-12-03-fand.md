>This was a pre final project done during Masters at IDC.

The video demonstrating the concept is shown below:

The goal of the project was to improve the productivity of existing desktop usage using foot as a secondary modality. Several explorations and ideation were done in light of previous works and user studies conducted. The final report will be available [here]() by end of the semester.

The post only covers some parts of a rather long design process (~ 6 months). I tried several techniques to understand the design of gesture systems. I did a [Wobbrock](https://faculty.washington.edu/wobbrock/) style study to derive the guess-ability of certain guestures. The users were should de-contextualized prompts to certain interactions and were asked to come up with responses. I would encourage reading the paper by Wobbrock et al.

The prompts were like the below for zoom:

Based on my **user set** the gesture set was as follows:

The gesture set was used with the following *design requirements* to come up with several concepts.

The most dominant concept was of a shareable foot accessory that was prototyped. The process of prototyping was done separately for both form and function.

Functional Prototype made using Arduino running thresholding and a simple wave pattern recognizer algo on the data of a MPU6050 gyro sensor

The prototype was tested with users using a true experiment design. The results showed that F(4,20) at p<0.05 the device when compared to a new type of hand device like trackpoint has statistical significance (repeated measures ANOVA).Hence, both devices have similar learnability.
