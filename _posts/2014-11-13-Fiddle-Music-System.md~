*Zu ZU ZU ZU ZU UUUU ..BR.BR.CHIK* Thats how my old 'Phillips All in One' failed a couple of weeks back. It was a pretty archaic piece. All it could do was play Cassettes, Do Radio, Had an Aux In and offcourse the marketed **CD Player with a segmented Display**. But today most of the music is digital and hence *Upgrade was necessary*.

I was planning to buy one and browsing the estores but then then *Makers Dilemma* struck me. 
> Why Buy? When it can be Built!

And alas! I was fiddling with microcontrollers and SD Cards to make one. But couldnt get to the level i wanted. I wanted one that could:

* Play MP3s
* Radio
* Aux -IN
* Take SD Cards
* Remotes will be good too.

Fitting such things in a project would rather be heavenly. I searched online for references and *You have it boy!* there is one ready to amplify (supply) module from our friends in China that does it all . See [this](http://www.dx.com/p/1-0-led-car-mp3-player-module-w-fm-usb-mini-usb-sd-remote-controller-black-12v-126115#.VGbgJ4X7sjg)  .

I had seen this in a Taxi (less formally called *Gramin Seva*) while commuting to college once, which made me realise that this would certainly be available in India. The next day i was in the market looking for it and I did source it for about 9 $ (INR 500 )

Now all i need to do is :

1. Decipher the connections
2. Build a power supply and Amplifier
3. Find/Repurpose/Build a Coaxial(1-Woof and 1-Tweeter) speaker box
4. Modify the box to fit all in 
5. Enjoy

**Connections** were pretty easy as the silkscreen had some references. It basically needs a `5V DC` supply thats the two pin connected on the left for and give **stereo** output using the 3 of 4 connectors on right (*Right, Left and GND*) and the last one is for the FM Antenna

The next part was testing if i will see the blue smoke of death as sometimes they can mess up with silkscreens too. *FingersCrossed*

It worked fine and i was playing things off the USB straight away!

Now, the power supply and Amplifier. I used the omnipresent `7805 Regulator` that could power the module easily as i estimated the current requirements to be around `250-300mA` . The supply was going to be `12VDC` due to the Amp i was building and hence, a heat sink was necessary.
The Amp was build out of **ST's** [TDA2030](http://www.st.com/st-web-ui/static/active/en/resource/technical/document/datasheet/CD00000128.pdf) which is a 14W,voltage friendly, High Fidelity (Correct Portrayl of sound without much loss in clarity), Class AB , Mono Amplifier.

The Application circuit works charm.
So, i assembled them on a single perfboard and was short of one heat sink. I now had to decide. Who needs the heat sink badly?

Demo runs showed `TDA2030` needs it badly. Now using some thermal glue and nuts and bolts i screwed the heatsink to the `TDA2030` and made a makeshift heat sink for `7805`

I heard a strange buzz sometimes in the background which was because of some filtering issues. Adding a snubber (filter) for AC frequencies (50Hz) that was almost gone. Used the `10k` and `0.1uF` combination. 

I had an Old but dis functional Column 2 component speaker, we had bought probably 12 years down the line. It was the ideal candidate for the purpose. Now opening and digging i found phenolic pcb with broken and corroded traces.I reworked them and the Woofer was working . (*Oh! Yeah*)

I planned to fit the circuit inside the speakerbox itself.For that i had to cut a small square pocket in the body for the module to peep out and the other electronics would be inside it.

This was a bit more difficult than anticipated. After 2 hours and 2 broken saw blades , 1 was able to do this.

Now it was assembling time.

After a few half hours, i got it all working.. No Buzz and all music!
