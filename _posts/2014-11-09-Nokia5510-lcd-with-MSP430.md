I had this Nokia LCD i picked up a while back. It is perfect when you want to play with graphics on a tiny lcd that comes from the good old days of Nokia's Monochome days. Several might have spent days playing space invaders/snakes etc. 

The time came when I was bored in my hotel room and I had it in my parts bin which i was carrying while moving from Delhi to Pune.

The LCD used a [Phillips PCD 8544 Driver](https://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/LCD/Monochrome/Nokia5110.pdf) which communicates on SPI.The voltage levels are `2.7-3.3V` happy for our MSP430.

*NYC* has a pretty nice explanation on how it works and how to play with it with MSP430 over on his [blog](http://www.msp430launchpad.com/2012/08/using-nokia-lcd-library.html) 

For TL:DR; 

The LCD has the following pins to interface to:
<style type="text/css">
.tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;}
.tg td{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;padding:10px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;}
.tg th{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-weight:normal;padding:10px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;}
</style>

The display is divided into 6 horizontal bands of 8 bits each (48) and 84 columns .

At a time you write to a single bank.

And you can continue to update only a single bank just in case you have dynamic data in that particular bank.

The communication is done using SPI.

The code that i used is based on [RobG's post](http://forum.43oh.com/topic/1312-nokia-5110-display/).

It displays the temperature (from the internal sensor ofcourse!) and some static text

Connections are as follows(PORT1):

* LCD5110_SCLK_PIN- BIT5
* LCD5110_DN_PIN- BIT7
* LCD5110_SCE_PIN- BIT0
* LCD5110_DC_PIN- BIT1
