>This project was done during Masters at IDC. The project was selected as winner in student design category at CHI 2017 in Denver, Colorado. The paper on the same has been included in conference proceedings and can be read [here](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3049268). The team members were [Udayan](https://www.behance.net/udayanvidyanta) and  [Silpa](https://www.behance.net/silpa_murali).


The competition brief can be read [here](https://chi2017.acm.org/designcompetition.html).

We chose to work on how might we help the elderly and digitally illiterate perform cashless transactions. The recent events of demonetization helped in setting up the premise for such a solution. Our main contribution was conducting several studies to try and understand the conceptual model elderly have towards performing such transactions.

The design process is covered in the video below :
