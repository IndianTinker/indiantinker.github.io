>I guess I´m too used to sitting in a small room and making  words do a few things. I see enough of humanity at the racetracks, the supermarkets, gas stations, freeways, cafes, etc. This can´t be helped. But I feel like kicking myself in the ass when I go to gatherings, even if the drinks are free. It never works for me. I´ve got enough clay to play with. People empty me. I have to get away to refill. I´m what´s best for me, sitting here slouched, smoking a beedie and watching this screen flash the words. Seldom do you meet a rare or interesting person. It´s more than galling, it´s a fucking constant shock. It´s making a god-damned grouch out of me. Anybody can be a god-damned grouch and most are. Help! 

— Charles Bukowski (The Captain is out to lunch and the sailors have taken over the ship)

<br>
Friday evenings are always a painful time. I seldom want to leave work. After the only plan I had, cancelled, I just sat in the office as saw people leave and shout Buen Finde. I on the other hand, do not want weekends to exist the way they do now. Maybe we can have any day we want off and get back to work the next day. Sometimes, I don’t want to work on Thursdays but I do want to work on a Saturday. But, I guess, That wont work in a structured society. 

<br>

On the weekend, I leave the structure to chance. That is what I do. I work on random things. To keep myself away from thoughts of indignified loneliness. Away from my acquired self annihilating feelings. Away from myself. 
<br>

On Saturday mornings, I read Bukowski as I get ready. Ready for my ritual. I like reading Bukowski. People frown at me for reading him. Whatever he is, but he is best at describing the banality of life. He is like meh all the time. These days, I am meh. 

<br>
At 9:30 sharp, I go to these driving classes on Zoom. They are theory lessons from a fellow Indian who helps other colonial anglosaxons pass the driving theory exam. He is direct. His dictum is a classic cornerstone of Indian pedagogy — Scare them until they perform and everything is ‘somehow’ related to survival.  But it is fun to be in the class. That is my only Indian connection in Spain, yet it feels very plastic. There are just voices with pseudonyms on a boring zoom class. No one is having fun. No one needs to. Because we are just here to pass with 90% grades as we have been manufactured to.
<br><br>

There are two breaks in the four hour class. I am preparing for another IITJEE exam. The same old grind. This is what I think of it. My brain. My exam prep. Pass or you are not worth it. 
<br>

The zoom class is quite functional. No one spends any effort in traveling. No one knows anyone. There is no community. There is a WhatsApp group. That group we all know. WhatsApp group are like promotions. Everyone wants one, but nobody wants to be in one.  
<br><br>

I need a break by now. Eyes are red and I am starving. I walk 3 km to *my* Indian place. He serves vegetable curry and naan bread for 2.50. EUR. The place is my personal embassy. My cocoon in the foreign land. I feel safe here. The atmosphere is great. All the colorful people come in and talk to the waiter. He welcomes them all. They don’t buy anything and just sit around. I was asked by one of them to subscribe to his youtube channel. He is called SlamDaddy. I did.

<br>
Me and the waiter talk in Spanish, but greet in Urdu and I place orders in Bengali. Today, I was not 100% emotionally, so, I drank some tea. Recently, I have been asked to drink as little tea as possible due to my anxiety. So, Saturday is the only day I have tea. I feel nice and anxious.
<br>

Sipping the tea, I look out of the gate. I see ‘other’ folks sitting on terraces eating British Indian food. The food looks great everywhere. At the doorstep, several people pass-by. Kids, mothers, parents, and pets. They all are going somewhere. Somewhere where they are reserved. 

<br>
After drinking the tea, I pay, and greet *Khuda Hafiz* and walk to my next destination.  This is the *Museo de Reina Sofia*. I love to go there. I feel welcomed there. It is my sanctuary and sanatorium. Museums are the great places. You can see things, learn a lot, and project your inner world on the abstractness they present. Also, you cannot be weirder than that painting. People have better things to stare. 
<br>
<br>
I bought a museum membership last year. A great investment. Just costed me two *menu-del-dias*. So, I often go before the museum’s free hours. I love the inviting emptiness. The personal grandeur of watching Joan Miro, Dali, and Picasso with just me around feels liberating. This weekend I am researching about *Gernica* for my postcard show. I went to see it. Last week, I was at *Museo del Prado* checking out *Goya’s Tres de Mayo*. Picasso was a great art historian apart from being an amazing painter and many believe *Tres de Mayo*’s lighting and hand have inspired *Gernica*. Interesting. 

I am giving away postcards for both of them for [my Postcard show](http://rohitg.in/pcshow/)! . [Sign up now](http://rohitg.in/pcshow/) :)

<br>
Apart from the galleries, there is a small corner in the garden where I sit and read. It has an olive tree nearby. The bench is in shade. It is surrounded by flowers and paths. The whole setting seem unreal. It is just missing a lake. The other benches do not offer this mysterious comfort. I have tried them all on other Saturdays.
<br>
Today, it was occupied by a beautiful girl in her 30’s. She was reading. I did not wanted to disturb her. So, I did not go to the garden. 
<br><br>
Fifteen minutes before the museum opens up for the market, I make a magical escape. I am back on the streets. My face covered with a mask. 
<br><br>
In a few minutes of walking, I go to *Rodilla*. This is the one near Atocha Station. 
<br><br>
This is where I am now. In my little corner. I order a tea (do not order a chai latte) and munch on a sandwich. The one called *queso con tomate* is my favorite one. This Rodilla is usually empty. Most people just get take-aways for their trains to their wonderlands. Often you can find people planning trips, solving family disputes, meeting old friends, like really old ones. Never have I heard people planning coups here. The place feels warm with human connections. Even with all this talking, its quite silent. I just stay here and pay my time with teas. 
<br><br>
I sit, I write, I draw, I ink.
<br><br>
As I sip tea, I wait. I wait for the weekend to end. 
<br><br>
