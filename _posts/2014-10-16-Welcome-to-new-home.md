I am now in process of migrating my main blog on [wordpress](http://indiantinker.wordpress.com) to github pages for more contexual/design/layout freedom. This blog is built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).

  > Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory [...] and spits out a complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache or your favorite web server. This is also the engine behind GitHub Pages, which you can use to host your projectâ€™s page or blog right here from GitHub.

Find out more by [visiting the project on GitHub](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll).

For those who have used [LaTeX](http://www.latex-project.org/) in the past Jekyll is excellent as it (personally saying) generates a static website by compiling all the code you wrote in the post.Obviously, with the luxury of **platforms** like wordpress,blogspot etc writing bare code is archaic. Jekyll has got your back here too, you never *write* the html/css tags from scratch. The Jekyll engine takes standard markdown which it builds into a html code and once built gives you a complete website. You an obviously code in html too.

Comments,widgets and Analytics work too with just a bit of playing required.
The comments on this site are supported via Disqus !

Hope this post compiles well ! :)
