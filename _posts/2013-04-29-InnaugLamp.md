Inauguration Lamps.. They are just so mainstream. The same one candle lighting the others one by one. Pretty Bucolic ! But Prof.Gadre had something different in mind for the inauguration of Texas Instruments Analog Design Challenge Finals in Blore,2013.

I was glad to be the part of the team doing all the work for the project. The concept was to use a conventional usability model and introduce a different way to light things up. In brevity,

> An electronic matchstick with a magnetic field sensor ( not a pricey hall sensor ) while be struck against a magic matchbox with a precise number of magnets. When the matchstick is struck with matchbox magic happens and the LEDs start lighting up on the matchstick. Ah! The matchbox is powered by a supercap mind you ! Hidden somewhere inside the matchstick is an IR LED, whispering a secret modulated code which can only be read by our compatible lamps that too only within a certain distance. When the Lamps see the matchstick they just light up ! No ghee teel, pure electronics !

We all worked for a few months on the project and the final versions demonstrated had two LEDs to indicate the state of the Lamps and were hand(routed-etched-drilled-soldered and assembled) at CEPD. The main diffuser was 3D printed in the Lab itself in the shape of a Flame.

The structure was made using industrially laser cut acrylic elements.
