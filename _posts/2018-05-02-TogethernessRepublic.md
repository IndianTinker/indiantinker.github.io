> This post presents a commissioned public installation on the occasion of Republic Day. [We](https://mkrv.in/) worked a creating an abstract digital reflection of the visitors to evoke feeling of togetherness. 

We tried to understand the work in terms<!--more--> of a popular saying about India, "Unity in Diversity". We aimed at exhibiting concepts that show how we as Indians, accommodate our diversity and stay united. A fundamental view was taken as it presents the visitor with an idea that essentially everyone is same and differences are ,as Harari says, fictional. Hence, a reflection was thought in terms of a shape and a structure. 

We used a Kinect sensor with OpenNI to implement this project.

#### Shape
The shape metaphor presents visitor with a enlarged silhouette of themselves. The colour of the silhouette varies between saffron,white and green. These are the colors from the national flag. When a lot of people come closer, they all merge into one band, symbolizing - oneness, unity

#### Structure
The structure metaphor was chosen to show abstract animated representations of self. These were inspired from human forms in the [Warli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warli) art style. The visitors would walk in front of the screen and notice their Warli representation. The forms react to the visitors motion. They are colored in the Indian tri-color.
