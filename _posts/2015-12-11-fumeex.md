Soldering generates some not so healthy lead fumes. A Fume extractor is a device that passes the fume through a charcoal foam which adsorbs the vapour particles and hence removes them from the air. 

As a demonstration for my [CNC]({%post_url 2015-12-10-karigar%}), i made this simple design that uses a PVC tube with slots cut for attaching a charcoal foam piece. I have a BLDC fan on at one end to create a suction force to suck the air with fumes. The entire frame was made from MDF and hot glued and snap-fitted in place.

The circle was cut using my CNC and the BLDC fan was fixed using 3mm nuts and bolts.There is an ON/OFF Switch as well.

LED lights help when soldering in dark.

It is powered using a standard 12V Wall Wart. The BLDC fan has a rating of 15V hence,the label.
