> This post describes the work done as a part of a course I took at *School of Design, IIT Bombay* . The name of the course is **Interaction Media and Senses**. The project was done during the *sensory* phase of the course that involved Sensory, Cognitive and Social parts. 

We explored the possible ways to experience at city by just sounds and ended up creating a system that maps these sounds as well. The system can be seen in action [here](http://rohitg.in/soundsofcity.html). It uses Mapbox flavoured openstreet maps with soundcloud to embed the recorded sounds.

We experimented with things like :

- Binaural Recording
- Storytelling with sound
- Spatial augmentation of sound using 3 axis sensors and openAL. (To be replaced by Unity or SFML)
- Geospatial Mapping of Sound (prototyped using processing and implemented using MapBox)
