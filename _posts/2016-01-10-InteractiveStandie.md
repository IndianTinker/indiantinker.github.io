Standies? They are everywhere. Every event. Every exhibition, Flying around, falling down numerous times, a pain to manage them and even get people to read it.

We had the opportunity to design a reactive standie for [Saavn](http://saavn.com/) that will be present at their stalls throughout NH7 2015 Music festival.

Its apparently a XXL Sized phone with a UI that lists the artists playing at that festival and has their albums on the standie itself. 

So, like a big screen a person could walk and press/tap/touch their artist and enjoy the selected music for the festival.

Checkout out the video of the standie in action.
