A friend was recently on a look-out for a camera (DSLR) for a project and was trying various options. Since the residual life of the camera depends on the *Shutter Count* ; its worth-while to check it before committing to it. BTW, If you need more pointers on evaluating a pre-owned Camera, I would sincerely recommend [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BxXPTIvtHA) video. PS: Language might not be suitable for younger audiences. 

On Linux (other platforms too) there is a nice tool called **ExifTool** which was, as of writing this post available in the package manager of *Ubuntu* .

So, Simply 
`sudo apt-get install exiftool`

In order to use it, Simply go to the SD Card (generally) and *Right Click* to open terminal here. Then use the command.

`exiftool DSC_0004.JPG |grep "Shutter Count"`

Shutter Count should be visible, But depends on the camera you use. Most **Nikons** we tested had this meta tag in the EXIF(Exchangeable image file format) data of the image, but the only Canon we tested was 1200D which did not show any data.
