I wake up the dawn, \\
from its quiet shambles.\\
Like a wanderer on road,\\
With his screechy corners.



The world lays lost,\\
in the dreams they believe .\\
I sit there awake,\\
dreaming to believe.


The wind i feel,\\
sweeps me away.\\
In its gusts it follows me,\\
To the worlds i never foray.


Sometimes i feel,\\
I should have said.\\
Those words i had,\\
she might have read.


May be it was a sad,\\
that those winds never blew.\\
May be it was great,\\
those things i never drew.


There will be a dawn soon,\\
to help us with the light.\\
To give us all the hope,\\
and bless us with the might.


Until that dawn,\\
I have to wait.\\
Search in the world,\\
and try my fate.


A day may come,\\
when I wake the dawn.\\
Welcoming a new world,\\
Then I shall carry-on.



Cheers,

Rohit
